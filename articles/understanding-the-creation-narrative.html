        <p>The opening chapters of Genesis set the stage for all biblical theology: they tell us about God, the cosmos, and humanity’s place within it. To grasp the profound truths here, we must rely on the clear teaching of Scripture itself, using sound logic rather than external philosophies or traditions. By holding fast to the text of the Bible and applying rational principles, we safeguard our interpretation from misdirection and honor the sufficiency of God’s Word.</p>

        <h2>Scripture’s Clarity and Sufficiency</h2>
        <p>Scripture claims to be self-interpreting: God’s Spirit illuminates understanding for those who read with a humble and teachable heart (2 Timothy 3:16–17). While historical context and language studies aid our comprehension, the fundamental truths of creation—God as Creator, the sequence of days, and the inherent goodness of His work—are plainly stated.</p>

        <aside class="pullquote" aria-label="pull quote">
          <p>Let the Bible speak for itself—and let reason trace the lines it draws.</p>
        </aside>

        <h2>The Role of Logic in Interpretation</h2>
        <p>Logic gives structure to our reading. We ask: What premises does the text establish? How do the statements relate? Genesis 1:1 asserts, “In the beginning God created…” From this, we deduce that God is eternal, distinct from creation, and supremely powerful. Each verse builds upon the last in a coherent narrative.</p>

        <h2>Guarding Against Extra-Biblical Overlays</h2>
        <p>Throughout history, interpreters have overlaid extra-biblical ideas—Platonic forms, modern scientism, or mystical schemes—onto Genesis. By committing to Scripture alone and using logical reflection, we reject ungrounded traditions and maintain fidelity to the Creator’s revealed account.</p>

        <h2>Texts in Context</h2>
        <blockquote class="scripture">
          <p><strong>Genesis 1:1–3</strong> — In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth… And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul class="refs">
          <li>2 Timothy 3:16–17 — Scripture as sufficient and profitable</li>
          <li>Psalm 33:6–9 — Creation by God’s word</li>
          <li>John 1:1–3 — The Word with God in the beginning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Understanding the Creation Narrative is not a contest of worldviews but patient listening to God’s own revelation and thoughtful application of reason. When we let the Bible speak and follow the natural flow of its logic, faith is anchored in the clarity and sufficiency of Scripture.</p>
