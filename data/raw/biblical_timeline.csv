0,Genesis 1:1-2,"Creation Week Begins-""the beginning""","Sunday, 6:00 p.m. on a solar calendar, is “the beginning” of Creation Week and the start of Monday, Creation Day 1 on the 364-Day Hebrew calendar consistent with the Biblical text. This 364-Day Bible Reference (BR) calendar digitally generates the main solar calendars used today. This opening verse of Scripture states that God begins the act of Creation by creating the space needed for the universe and matter in the form of the earth. When it is 6:00 p.m. in what is now known as Israel, it is 3:00 a.m. on the International Date Line of the same day. It is important to understand that a 24-hour Hebrew calendar day starts at 6:00 p.m. of the day prior to a normal solar calendar day that starts at midnight. On the Gregorian solar calendar, generated by the 364-Day calendar, the start time of Creation Week is 6:00 p.m. on Sunday, October 21 in 4101 BC. It is from this moment in time that the events of Scripture can be measured on the solar calendars and clocks currently in use today. The Julian day number, given on this date on the solar calendar, is at the end of Sunday at 6:00 p.m. This moment in time starts the beginning of Monday, Creation Day 1 on the Hebrew calendar consistent with the dated events of Scripture. All future Julian day numbers represent the day number at the start of the Hebrew day at 6:00 p.m. This is the moment time begins. From this point on, a segment of eternity can be measured on a calendar in days, weeks, months and years.","""the beginning""",362,0,0,Monday,October,14,Creation Day,1,4115,BC,Sunday,October,21,Creation Day,7,4101,BC,S,4,223858.75,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,Genesis 1:1-5,Creation Day 1 ,"Time intersects and anchors into eternity as time begins the events of Creation Day 1. On this “first day”, the heavens, earth, time, light and energy are created. Time begins as God starts the act of Creation by creating a great deal of space. Into this large amount of space, God creates a large amount of formless and seemingly non-energized matter called earth. This monument event of Creation Week that is both incomprehensible and unexplainable is described with very few words in Genesis 1:1-2: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters”. This seemingly effortless action taken by God is followed by his first recorded command in Genesis 1:3: “Let there be light”; and there was light.” \pMany commentaries on this verse emphasize the theory that God simply turns on the light in a vast expanse of darkness during this part of the Creation process. We can easily miss the significance of this event if we assume that God was working in the dark prior to this moment. This verse is Genesis is describing a much more significant act of Creation that is easily missed by the economy of words in the text. The light that we see is only one of more than 75 octaves of known forms of light. The entire electromagnetic spectrum of light is infused as energy into all matter and seemingly empty space. Science claims that even in empty space, that contains no molecules of matter, there is a tremendous amount of energy. This “light” is the glue that gives shape and motion to the chemical elements that make up space and matter. At the moment “light” is created in history, all matter and space is energized and begins to move. \pHistory begins and everything exists in measurable time. In Genesis 1:3, God starts and continually sustains the constantly moving and energized universe. Time and history begin with the simple declaration of His Word, “Let there be light”; and there was light”.  The Julian day number given on this date is at the end of Monday at 6:00 p.m. which starts the beginning of Tuesday, Creation Day 2. All future Julian day numbers, ending digitally with .75, represent the day number at the start of the Hebrew calendar day at 6:00 p.m. This Bible Timeline research will clearly show that the 364-Day calendar, consistent with Scripture, digitally starts on this day and generates the solar calendars used on earth today.",Day#1 Creation,362,0,1,Monday,October,14,Creation Day,1,4115,BC,Monday,October,22,Heshvan ,1,4101,BC,S,5,223859.75,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Genesis 1:6-8,Creation Day 2,"Space and matter are separated on Creation Day 2. Day 2 of Creation Week is another day of separation and order. On this day, the earth that is covered in water is separated by a space called the “firmament” which God calls “Heaven” in Genesis 1:8. This “firmament” is the sky and space above that we see when we look up from the earth. In this atmosphere wrapped around the earth, in this space called heaven, there is also a great amount of water in the form of thick clouds which some refer to as a canopy of water vapor around the earth. The exact nature of this water area above the area called firmament or heaven cannot be precisely known as it has apparently changed since the time of Noah’s Flood. In Scripture, the first heaven is what we would call our atmosphere and is what is created on Creation Day 2. The second heaven in Scripture is created on Creation Day 4 when God makes the sun, moon, stars, and everything we refer to as the universe beyond our atmosphere. The third heaven of Scripture is what we normally refer to as the place where God is seen and the dwelling place of the saints. This third heaven is referred to by Paul in 2 Corinthians 12:2.",Day#2 Creation,363,0,2,Tuesday,October,15,Creation Day,2,4115,BC,Tuesday,October,23,Heshvan ,2,4101,BC,S,6,223860.75,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,Genesis 1:9-13,Creation Day 3,"The first plant life forms are made on Creation Day 3. On this third day of Creation, God makes His last main separation by dividing the water from the land. The day starts with an earth covered by water. The day ends with the water gathered in one place and the appearance of dry land. The description in Chapter 1 of Genesis seems to imply, that at the end of this third day of Creation, there is one piece of land that is surrounded by one body of water. This appears to be consistent with what is seen by looking at a globe of the earth. The current continents appear to have once been one piece that was broken up like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle at the time of Noah’s Flood. God simply speaks and the waters separate and the land appears. “God called the dry land earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called seas”. The earth that was once “without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep”, described in Genesis 1:2, now has the shapes formed by earth (land) and sea that can be seen due to the presence of light. The land and the water are now both divided shapes of matter that can be filled with all forms of life “according to its kind”. God spoke again and “the earth brought forth grass, the herb that yields seeds according to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind”, according to Genesis 1:12. All plant life was fully grown and able to reproduce itself. The fruit, seeds and plants would also produce food for the animal life that would be created on days five and six of Creation Week. We can reasonably assume that there was also plant life in the seas as well as the land. Even though the sun would not be created until the next day, the process of photosynthesis in plants that produces oxygen for water and land animals would have started due to the presence of the light that was created on Creation Day 1 of Creation Week.",Day#3 Creation,364,0,3,Wednesday,October,16,Creation Day,3,4115,BC,Wednesday,October,24,Heshvan ,3,4101,BC,S,7,223861.75,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,Genesis 1:14-19,Creation Day 4,"Creation Day 4 becomes the completion and fulfillment of Creation Day 1. On Creation Day 1 the separation between darkness and light is created by the creation of light. On the fourth day, the light created on Creation Day 1 is attached to or reflected by the heavenly bodies such as stars, moons, planets, comets and our sun. Genesis 1:14 states, the ""lights in the firmament"" begin functioning as transmitters of light. On the fourth day of Creation, God attaches the light He has made on the first day of Creation to the different ""heavenly bodies"". This totally removes the argument for an old earth because some stars are four million light years away. The argument claims that we are seeing the light that left such stars four million years ago. What we are seeing is the light that left such stars about 6,113 solar years ago, when the universe was created. God created the stars and the light between them and earth at the same time. The sun and stars appear to produce their own light as they burn matter. Planets and moons reflect light from stars. Science claims that the sun appears to be made up of 98% helium and hydrogen. Science is unable to explain the process by which the sun burns many thousands of tons of this matter every second. It has been known for many years that the sun is shrinking in diameter at a rate of about five feet in diameter per day. One scientist has estimated that if the sun were 50,000 years old, the oceans on earth would have boiled unless the sun was a much greater distance away. Several scientists have concluded that based on the speed of the shrinking sun, it seems impossible that the sun and earth could be older than about 7,000 years. This fact and other scientific findings, like the measured decline of earth’s magnetic field since 1830, show that the earth cannot be more than 10,000 years based on our knowledge of certain scientific realities of physics. The reader is encouraged to do their own research of the facts in order to properly discern scientific fact from fictional evolutionary theory that is not based on true scientific investigation.",Day#4 Creation,1,0,4,Thursday,October,17,Creation Day,4,4115,BC,Thursday,October,25,Heshvan ,4,4101,BC,S,8,223862.75,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,Genesis 1:20-23,Creation Day 5,"On Creation Day 5, God speaks swarms of living creatures into the sea and fills the expanse above the earth with birds. Creation Day 5 is the first day of conscious life forms. On Creation Day 3, plants were made that were living things but without consciousness or the ability to independently move freely. According to Genesis 1:22, God commands all living creatures in the sea and air (heavens) to: “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters of the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth”.  The same command is given to all the animals on land and to Adam and Eve on the sixth day of Creation Week. On the Gregorian-Hebrew Calendar (GH), the corresponding date for the fifth day of Creation Week is Friday October 26 – Heshvan 5, 4101 BC (GH). The ability to reproduce in obedience to God’s command is only possible because each species has its own DNA coding. On days three, five, and six, the phrase “according to its kind” is used a total of ten times in Genesis 1:11-25. On Day 3 it is very clear that grass, herbs and fruit trees produce other plants with the same genetic coding. Grasses do not become fruit trees. There is no evolutionary process of one species becoming another. \pThere is no mention in Scripture of simple life forms evolving upwards to form more complex living organisms. Like the other days of Creation Week, God simply speaks His Word and an uncountable number of living creatures fill the sea and the air. All creatures are created full grown with their own unique genetic coding completely formed. According to Genesis 1:20-21, this all happened on the fifth day when God says; “Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens”.  So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters abounded, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good”. \pIt is very clear from Scripture that birds do not evolve from reptiles as is commonly touted by some evolutionary scientists. While there may be variation and change within a species after creation, such as different kinds of dogs, this has absolutely nothing to do with the instantaneous creation of all the different species of birds and water creatures in one 24-hour period. Science, with its vast amount of information, has absolutely no way of explaining or contributing to our understanding of how the incredible events of Creation Week happened. Evolutionary explanations defy every form of rational process and known true science. There are two main reasons that science has difficulty explaining Evolution. Evolution is biologically impossible and there is no scientific evidence for it because it never happened.",Day#5 Creation,2,0,5,Friday,October,18,Creation Day,5,4115,BC,Friday,October,26,Heshvan ,5,4101,BC,S,9,223863.75,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"Genesis 1:24-31, 2:7-25",Creation Day 6,"God begins the sixth day of Creation Week by creating all land-based creatures “according to its kind”, according to Genesis 1:24-25. The land animals are divided into “cattle and creeping things and beast of the earth”. Cattle would probably include all four-legged domestic animals. The beasts of the earth would refer to all other land-based animals including the dinosaurs. Creeping things would refer to all forms of animals that walk on the earth, including all forms of insects that fly or move in some manner on the ground. Creation Day 6 is finished with the creation of Adam and Eve. With reference to Adam and Eve, Scripture does not use the phrase “according to its kind”. Instead Genesis 1:26-28 states, ”Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth”. So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth”. It is very clear that God created Adam and Eve to be the only animal in creation that can reproduce offspring that will be “in the image of God.” Adam and Eve were the first and only man and woman created fully mature. Adam and Eve were created by God on Saturday, October 19 – Day Six of Creation Week in 4115 BC. The Gregorian-Hebrew Calendar (GH) date for the sixth day of Creation, is Saturday, October 27 – Heshvan 6 in 4101 BC (GH).",Day#6 Creation,3,0,6,Saturday,October,19,Creation Day,6,4115,BC,Saturday,October,27,Heshvan ,6,4101,BC,S,10,223864.75,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adam is the father of Seth and male ancestor of all human beings. Like the other parts of the created order, Adam and Eve are blessed by God and instructed to: “Be fruitful and multiply” and “fill the earth”. Adam and Eve are also instructed to subdue the earth and have dominion over all of God’s Creation. The phrase, “according to its kind”, is applied to all the birds, fish, and land animals, but not to Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve are the only part of Creation made in “His own image; in the image of God He created them”.",Day#6 Creation,3,0,6,Saturday,October,19,Creation Day,6,4115,BC,Saturday,October,27,Heshvan ,6,4101,BC,S,10,223864.75,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9,Genesis 2:1-6,God Blessed the Seventh Day ,"Genesis 2:1-3 says, “Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made”. Creation Day 7 is certainly a day that has been set apart from the other six days of Creation Week. Creation Day 7 is the day that God “sanctified” and “rested” from His Creation. God rested because Creation was complete. Genesis 1:31 states, “God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good”. God had created everything and it was perfect. Since sin had not entered the Creation equation at this point in time, there was no death, dying, decay, or disease. There was no rain, tornadoes, earthquakes, bad weather or weeds. Man did not have to work hard just to survive. Any plant food that was needed was readily available in some form of seed, fruit or vegetable for all of God’s creatures, including Man. There was a great abundance and diversity of types of food. Killing another animal to eat was not necessary. God ceased from all His creative work because nothing else needed to be done. When Adam and Eve fell into disobedience, God then turned His attention to the preservation of a fallen world that was always plunging toward death and decay. Since He is a Holy God and “the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23)"", God then began the process of Redemption. Since the penalty for sin is both eternal and spiritual death, Scripture begins to record the history of Salvation in Genesis 3:15 where it states, “He shall bruise your head”. This is the first mention of the “He” who would bring Salvation. The significance of Creation Day 7 is given more commentary by Moses during the Exodus. Jesus gives more insight into the purpose of the Sabbath and the inappropriate idolization of Creation Day 7 among the spiritually blind Jewish leaders in His teachings in the New Testament.",Day#7 Creation,4,0,7,Sunday,October,20,Creation Day,7,4115,BC,Sunday,October,28,Heshvan ,7,4101,BC,S,11,223865.75,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,Genesis 3:1-21,The Temptation and Fall of Man,"The events of the Fall, and other events before the birth of Seth, are all estimated EST dates. Some historians have placed this event immediately after the Creation of Adam and Eve. Others have placed this event as much as 100 years later. Considering the depth of the fallen nature of mankind, this author and others have estimated this date is about two weeks after Creation Week. In this part of Scripture, we are given a very clear picture of Satan’s strategy for leading humans down the path to disobedience to God and His Word. Genesis 3:1 records the first question in recorded history, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?” One of Satan’s most effective tools is to get us to question God’s Word.  Notice how Satan twists the question to imply that God would not allow Eve to eat from “every tree of the garden” instead of just the one tree in the “midst” of the garden that was prohibited. God had been very specific in his instructions to Adam in Genesis 2:17 where it states: “Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die”. These instructions are obviously given by Adam to Eve as seen in her statement to Satan in Genesis 3:2-3. After planting the seed of doubt in Eve’s mind about what God had actually said, Satan then turns his attention to casting doubt on God’s motives in giving instructions about the deadly consequences of disobedience to His Word. \pThe resulting first and still most popular of Satan’s lies, “You will not surely die”, is found in Genesis 3:4. Every lie related to the theory of Evolution is some form of questioning, lying, or twisting of God’s Word in order to persuade people to foolishly think that there are no serious or eternal consequences for disobedience to His Word. It is easy to ignore the consequences of disobedience to God’s Word as soon as you start doubting what He said. Those who think that the “days” of Creation Week mean something different than ordinary 24-hour days have fallen into this deception that comes straight from Hell. Once you begin to think of death and dying and millions of years of evolutionary “change by chance”, why would you need a Savior from the effects of the Fall? If Genesis 1:1 is not real history, in what chapter and verse do you think God starts telling the truth? This is always a good question to ask if you are listening to one of the many false teachers telling you the “real” meaning of the Book of Genesis and describes the days of Creation Week as something different than ordinary 24-hour days. Satan’s plan has always been to deceive people into thinking God’s Word does not mean what it says, there will be no serious consequences to disobedience, and God does not have your best interests in making His laws. This research will clearly show that belief in any form of Evolution is contrary to the stated text in Scripture. Belief in any form of an evolutionary lie is inconsistent with a belief in the God of the Bible as a totally sovereign Creator.",EST,18,0,21,Sunday,November,3,Heshvan,14,4115,BC,Sunday,November,11,Heshvan ,21,4101,BC,S,25,223879.75,0,14,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,Genesis 3:22-24,Adam and Eve are Cast Out of the Garden,"When God casts Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden, this is probably an act of mercy and protection in addition to being a consequence of disobedience to God’s clear command. Before creating Eve in Genesis 2:17, God clearly explained to Adam the consequences of eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil when He says, “you shall surely die”. Fortunately for the rest of mankind, the resulting death from disobedience was not immediate. Adam would live another 930 years, according to Genesis 5:4-5, and would father many sons and daughters. Now that Adam and Eve were in a fallen state of sin, it is conceivable that if they ate from the Tree of Life, they would live forever in this fallen state. Obviously that was not God’s plan. It was God’s plan to begin providing a way of Salvation so that redeemed mankind could live forever in heaven with Him. God removes them from the Garden where they begin the process of dying. Fortunately for mankind, it would take Adam over 900 years before he would experience the physical penalty of death. Adam and Eve will experience living in a fallen world while experiencing God’s Grace and promise of a future eternal life with Him without the presence of sin. Adam and Eve at this point are like God in the sense that they know the difference between Good and Evil. God knows Good and Evil due to His Holiness and Omniscience. Evil is not a part of God nor is it generated from Him. In contrast, Adam and Eve know Good and Evil by experience and will spend the rest of their lives learning that God’s Word means what He says and that there are consequences when we are disobedient to His commands. It could be argued that Adam and Eve were naïve to the consequences of sin since they had never witnessed any form of death prior to the Fall. This event of being removed from the Garden of Eden should give us all reason to make sure we understand what God’s Word says and what it means by what it says. Being ignorant or naïve about His Word does not remove us from the consequences of our sinful actions and desires.",EST,26,0,29,Monday,November,11,Heshvan,22,4115,BC,Monday,November,19,Heshvan ,29,4101,BC,S,33,223887.75,0,8,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,Genesis 4:1,Birth of Cain-Son of Adam and Eve,"Cain appears to be the firstborn of the “secular line” of Adam and Eve. Seth would be the firstborn of the “sacred line” through Adam and Eve. The “secular line” refers to the descendants of Cain. Many of Cain’s descendants are named in order of birth, without giving the age of the father at the time of the heir’s birth. There is no way to precisely track the secular line descendants in a Timeline that is connected back to Creation Week or any other dated event in Scripture. Those who follow in the secular line are generally historic enemies of their brothers in the “sacred line”. Jacob and Esau, Isaac and Ishmael, would be good examples of family lines that are frequent enemies in history. In contract, the sacred line can be traced from Creation through King David to the birth of Jesus. The sacred line of Jesus, through Joseph, the husband of Mary, is found in Matthew 1:1-17. This unique section of Scripture uses 14 consecutive 40-year spans for connecting generations, rather than the actual birth order of father and son. The sacred line of Jesus, through his mother, Mary can be found in Luke 3:23-38. This is the first EDFC (estimated date from Creation) since the number of years from Creation until this event is not stated. This is the DFC date for one year from Creation Day 3 in 4115 BC.

14,Genesis 4:3-4,Cain and Abel Make an Offering to the Lord,"Cain and Abel present an offering to the Lord. Cain is estimated to be 30 years old when this event happens. Both Cain and Abel had apparently received instructions on making a sacrificial offering to God. These instructions are not recorded in the text of Scripture. It does appear that one way God measures loyalty and obedience in a person’s heart is by the attitude of giving to Him. Cain was a tiller of the ground and Abel took care of sheep. Like many farmers today, Cain and Abel probably raised both crops and animals but tended to specialize in one or the other so they would be able to offer either type of sacrifice. Both occupations appear to be respectable to God. It is the condition of the servant’s heart that is of concern to God. Like all DFC and EDFC dates from this point on in the Bible Timeline, the Calendar Day Number (CD#6) is one-fifth of the number of years since Creation Day 3 of Creation Week.

29,"Genesis 4:25, 5:3; Luke 3:38",Birth of Seth-Son of Adam,"Seth is the firstborn in the “sacred line” or “blessed” heirs of Adam and Eve. The lineage of Jesus can be traced back though Seth to Adam. The sacred line of Jesus, through Joseph, the husband of Mary, is found in Matthew 1:1-17. This unique section of Scripture uses 14 consecutive 40-year spans for connecting generations, rather than the actual birth order of father and son. The sacred line of Jesus, through his mother, Mary, can be found in Luke 3:23-38. In contrast, the “secular line” refers to the descendants of Cain. Many of Cain’s descendants are named in order of birth, without giving the age of the father at the time of the heir’s birth. There is no way to precisely track secular line descendants in a Timeline. Those who follow in the secular line are generally historic enemies of their brothers in the “sacred line”. Jacob and Esau, Isaac and Ishmael, would be good examples of family lines that are frequent enemies in history. \pThe birth of Seth is the first DFC date that can be accurately measured from the number of years from Creation given in the Biblical text. The DFC date of birth for Seth is 130 years and 26 days after Creation Day 3 of Creation Week. Seth is born 130 years and 23 days after the creation of his parents, Adam and Eve on Creation Day 6 in 4115 BC. Seth is the father of Enosh.

Abraham is born when his father, Terah, is 70 years old. Abraham is the father of Isaac. Many commentaries erroneously claim that Terah is 130 when Abraham is born. This 60 year error has gone often unchallenged since it was introduced by James Ussher in his 17th century dating of the events in Biblical and world history. Ussher’s error triggered a series of mathematical miscalculations in the start of the Babylonian Exile in 588 BC and the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple in 515 BC. Even though most of Ussher’s dates prior to 454 BC have proven incorrect, these three main errors remain firmly entrenched in modern Bible chronology. Ussher’s calculation of the number of years from Creation until the birth of Jesus was 3,999. Instead, the correct number of solar years is 4,096 which are clearly stated in the Biblical text (See Exact Years Chart in Chapter 29). This error was the main stumbling block of subsequent attempts at calculating an accurate Bible chronology. The correction of this mathematical error was extremely difficult prior to the invention of the computer and an Excel spreadsheet.

The accurate DFC dating of Sarah’s death and Abraham’s move to Hebron are extremely important dates in the study of Bible chronology. At the time of Sarah’s death in Hebron, Abraham was probably living in Beersheba, according to Genesis 21:33-34. It is not clear whether or not Beersheba was considered as part of Canaan or outside the border at this time in history. Genesis 23:19 makes it clear that Hebron is in Canaan when Abraham moves there at the time of Sarah’s death. The death of Sarah happens two years after the death of Abraham’s father, Terah. Abraham would remain in Hebron until his death, thirty-eight years later, at the age of 175. This dating of this event clarifies Acts 7:2-4 and Hebrews 11:8-10.

153,Genesis 37:12-36,Joseph at 17 is Taken to Egypt,"On Friday, January 4 - Tevet 15, 1897 BC, Joseph is with his father Jacob at their home in Hebron in the land of Canaan.  Jacob and his family had moved from Bethel to Hebron two and a half years earlier after the death of Jacob’s wife, Rachel. Rachel died giving birth to Jacob’s youngest son, Benjamin just outside of Bethlehem. This event is described in Genesis 35:16-19. Benjamin was the only younger brother of Joseph who was also born to Rachel. Joseph had recently told his father and brothers about a dream in which his older brothers and “the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to me”, as recorded in Genesis 37:5-10. Joseph had previously brought back a negative report about his brothers to his father Jacob. Jacob had seemingly rewarded him with a tunic of many colors and showed obvious favoritism to Joseph (Genesis 37:3). Jacob seemed to ignore the obvious hostility and resentment toward Joseph by his older brothers. Verse 12 tells us that Jacob had sent the other brothers off to Shechem, about 40 miles away, to feed one of their flocks of sheep. Jacob decides to send Joseph to check on his brothers and bring him back a report. This was a decision that Jacob would regret but was obviously part of God’s plan to move Jacob and his family to Egypt twenty-two years later. Two days later, Joseph arrived in Shechem but his brothers are not where he expected to find them. Verses 15-17 tell of a man who found Joseph wandering in a field at Shechem. Many think this man may have been an angel or messenger sent from God to direct Joseph to his brothers who had moved the flocks to Dothan, about 10 miles away. \pThe move to Dothan was very important since this put Joseph’s brothers in view of the trading routes between Gilead and Egypt. On Friday, January 4 at the age of 17, Joseph found his brothers feeding the flocks at Dothan. As soon as his brothers saw him coming they began to plan his demise. When Joseph’s oldest brother Reuben heard his brothers plan to kill Joseph, he suggested they just put Joseph in an empty pit or well. Verse 21 tells how Reuben’s plan was to put Joseph in a pit and then come back later to rescue him and take him to his father. The brothers grabbed Joseph and removed his beautiful multicolored tunic given to him as a special gift from their father, Jacob. They threw him into an empty pit with no water. This was probably a dry well. Verse 25 tells how the brothers sat down to eat a meal after Joseph was in the pit and Reuben was apparently not present at that moment. The brothers saw a caravan of Midianite traders passing by and at Judah’s suggestion sold Joseph into slavery. Midianites are also called Ishmaelites in verse 25 since they are descendants of Ishmael through his wife, Keturah described in Genesis 25:1-2. Joseph was sold into slavery for twenty shekels of silver. This was a common practice at this time in history among some non-Hebrew people. \pUnder Mosaic law at the time of the Exodus, 452 years later, kidnapping and selling an Israelite was punishable by the death penalty, according to Exodus 21:16 and Deuteronomy 24:7.  By 30 AD, the cost of a slave had only risen to 30 pieces of silver. This is the amount that Judas, the disciple of Jesus, got for betraying Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. Joseph was taken to Egypt and sold to Potiphar, “an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard”, as recorded in Verse 36. When Reuben came back to rescue Joseph from the pit, he was very grieved to find out that Joseph had been sold into slavery. He probably joined in the cover up since he would have been held responsible by his father since he was the oldest. The brothers killed a “kid of the goats” (Verse 31) and dipped the colorful tunic of Joseph into the young goat’s blood. They brought this to their father who identified the tunic as belonging to Joseph. Jacob assumed, from the evidence presented that his son, Joseph was dead. It is interesting to note that Jacob was deceived by his sons, in a similar way that he deceived his father, Isaac to steal the inheritance from Esau, as described in Genesis 27:18-19. Both stories involve the use of a freshly killed young goat in the deception. This might explain why Jacob does not seem very upset with his sons when he later finds out that Joseph is alive and he had been previously deceived by his sons. It would be 22 years later that Jacob would see Joseph in Egypt. At this point in history, Jacob is 108 years old.

190,Genesis 47:1-10,130 Year Old Jacob Meets Pharaoh,"This event also marks the thirty-ninth DFC year in the life of Joseph. When the Egyptian Pharaoh meets Jacob he asks him: “How old are you?” When Jacob replies that he is 130 years old, the chronological trail in years from Creation, that seemed to be omitted at the birth of Joseph, is now reestablished. Jacob’s meeting with Pharaoh establishes the starting point of the 430 years in Egypt. Some Bible commentaries start the 430 years in Egypt when Abraham leaves Haran at the age of seventy-five. According the numbered years in Scripture, Abraham leaves Haran 215 years before Jacob’s arrival in Egypt. The 430 years of Egyptian Captivity ends with Israel making first camp at Succoth 430 years and 86 days after Jacob meets the Pharaoh. The first day out of Egypt for the Exodus would come on Friday, April 4 - Nisan 17 in 1445 BC.

210,Exodus 2:11-15; Acts 7:23-29,Moses Kills an Egyptian and Flees to Midian at Age 40,"Moses’ “apparent step-brother,” the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III and son of Queen Hatshepsut, seeks to kill Moses after Moses kills an Egyptian for abusing a Hebrew slave in 1485 BC. Moses is forty years old when he flees Egypt and goes to Midian. This is the most likely start of “about” 450 years of the Judges mentioned in Acts 13:20-22. In 1035 BC, 450 years later, King Saul is in the fifteenth year of his reign. Samuel is the King’s Prophet and the future King David is five years old. This seems to be one of several explanations to fit the text of Acts 13:20-22. See commentary in the MacArthur Study Bible on Exodus 2:23-25 and Acts 13:20-22. Israel’s condition of bondage and hardship would worsen with the beginning of the reign of Pharaoh Amenhotep II in 1450 BC.

470,Joshua 10:12-14,Sun Stands Still Allowing Defeat of Amorites,"There has been much speculation in Biblical commentaries to explain this text. Scripture is clear that the sun stood still and the moon stopped. Many claim some form of a solar eclipse that kept the sun's heat from Israel’s soldiers until they prevailed against the Amorites. Other commentaries claim that the sun appeared to stop. Joshua 10:13 is very clear: “So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day”. American Indians, who would have been on the other side of the earth, talk about the “long night” that occurred at this same time in history. This research concludes that what is probably being described here is a 48-hour day with one sunrise and one sunset. The obvious purpose of this miracle is to show God’s power in giving Israel a victory over the Amorites. It is also an answer to Joshua’s public prayer request before all of Israel. In relation to the effect on earth’s calendars, this is one of eight days needed to line up the 364-Day calendar, consistent with the Old Testament from Creation to the birth of Jesus, with the Gregorian calendar used today. The conclusion of this research is that this event happens on a Friday that is extended to cover a 48-hour period. On the Gregorian calendar, this would digitally show up as two days on the computer generated Gregorian calendar.

854,2 Samuel 6:1-15,The Ark is Brought to Jerusalem,"The return of the Ark may be marked as the end of 450 years of the Judges beginning with Amenhotep II, the new oppressive Pharaoh in Egypt in 1450 BC. This is the Pharaoh who would meet with Moses five years later in 1445 BC when Moses is eighty years old. This “about” 450 year period is mentioned in Acts 13:20-22. If this period of time is moved fifteen years earlier at the start, around 1465 BC, then the 450 years would end about the time of the death of Samuel estimated to be around 1015 BC. The 450 year period may also be measured as starting in 1485 BC when Moses flees Egypt at the age of forty after killing an Egyptian. This event happens during the reign of the Egyptian Pharaoh, Thutmose III. Thutmose III is the non-related step-brother of Moses who is raised as an Egyptian Prince by Queen Hatshepsut. Queen Hatshepsut may be the Pharaoh’s daughter who found Moses in the ark of bulrushes in the reeds of the Nile River, described in Exodus 2:1-10. Thutmose III is the Pharaoh of the Oppression, according to the New King James Version of the “MacArthur Study Bible (Page 3)” and many other sources.

977,Book of Jonah,Jonah: The Reluctant Prophet,"The story of Jonah is one of the most popular Old Testament tales told to children in Sunday school classes all over the world. Scripture clearly treats this as real history and not an allegory as many claim. The universal message is very clear that the God of the Bible is the God of all people, Jew or Gentile. The message is also clear that anyone willing to repent and turn to God can be saved. The story of Jonah contains theological messages for individuals and nations. Jonah is the only minor Prophet mentioned by name by Jesus. The author of this Timeline research dates this event near the year 764 BC. The year before there had been a severe plague which may have helped prepare the hearts of the people of Nineveh to repentance. This date would be in the eighth year of Jeroboam II (North) and the twenty-second year of Amaziah (South). The connection to the reign of Jeroboam II is found in 2 Kings 14:24. There is much agreement that the Assyrian King was Ashurdan III who ruled from 771 BC until 754 BC. Jonah was a contemporary of the Prophets Amos and Joel. Jonah is often identified by Jewish historians as being the son of the widow at Zarephath. The widow’s son was raised from the dead by Elijah in 1 Kings 17.

1013,2 Kings 18:9-12,End of Reign of Hoshea and Northern Kingdom,"This end of the Northern Kingdom of Israel is usually stated as happening around 721 BC. The 721 BC date is inconsistent with the numbers in Scripture by about 60 years. It is assumed by many Bible Chronologists that there are about thirty-five to sixty years missing in the Assyrian dates. This research shows that the dates for the start of the Babylonian Exile in 526 BC, instead of 586 BC, and the end of the Northern Kingdom in 665 BC, instead of 721 BC, are significant mathematical errors deeply imbedded in current Bible chronology. This research concludes that many of the Assyrian dates are likely accurate and completely consistent with the numbers found in the Masoretic text of Scripture. The reign of Northern King Hoshea lasts nine accession years and 184 days. The DFC date for the end of the Northern Kingdom is six accession years and one day into the reign of Southern King Hezekiah.

Hezekiah was assessed three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. King Hezekiah gave King Sennacherib “all the silver from the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the King’s house”. King Hezekiah also stripped the gold from the doors of the Temple and gave it the King of Assyria. It is possible that King Sennacherib is not the King of Assyria mentioned in this part of Scripture. King Sennacherib appears to have ruled earlier. At this point in time in Scripture, there is a discrepancy of forty to sixty years in the text compared to current Bible chronology. The name of a foreign King in the Biblical text may be a translation problem due to the fact that foreign kings often go by different names. More research needs to be done to clarify this issue.

According to http//topicalbible.org/s/sharezer.htm, “The Babylonian Chronicle says concerning Sennacherib’s death: “On the 20th day of Tebet Sennacherib, king of Assyria, was slain by his son in a revolt”. This differs from the Old Testament account in that it speaks of only one murderer, and does not give his name. How the two accounts can be harmonized is still uncertain. Further research will likely show some of the currently named foreign kings are identified by the wrong name since the current Bible chronology dates for this period are not in harmony with Scripture by as much as 60 years.

1023,2 Kings 20:8-11; Isaiah 38:8,The Sundial is Turned Back in Time,"Many translations read that “the sun returned ten degrees”. This is more likely “ten steps”. Some commentators speculate that a stairway had been built by King Ahaz to function as a sundial measurement devise. People could tell the time of day according to what step the shadow of the sundial was on. This author estimates that by moving ten steps backwards, time was reversed three hours. Since three hours would be repeated as the sundial resumed its normal pace, this particular day would be thirty hours in length. This was a very clear sign from the Lord that Hezekiah would not die from his illness and would live another 15 years. It is interesting to note that King Ahaz, father of King Hezekiah, had refused a sign from the Lord, according to Isaiah 7:10-12.  If this author’s assessment is correct about the working of the sundial, this event also has a practical application to the solar calendar. From this point forward, a solar calendar day would be counted as starting at midnight instead of 6:00 p.m. of the previous day as it does on a Hebrew calendar.

Based on its placement in the Old Testament, this Prophet seems to follow closely after Nahum. The introduction to Habakkuk in the “MacArthur Study Bible” is very helpful in getting an estimate on the date of this minor Prophet. The rise of the Chaldeans, also known as the Babylonians, mentioned in Habakkuk 1:6 is probably a reference to the rise in power of Babylon during the time of Nabopolassar. Jeremiah has been a Prophet for thirteen years and Daniel is almost four years old. King Josiah is in the twenty-seventh year of his reign and Ezekiel is eight years old. In two years, Nebuchadnezzar will marry the daughter of Astayges and the following year Nineveh will fall to the Babylonian army. In ten years, Nebuchadnezzar will be made the King of Babylon, after deporting Daniel and others the previous year. These are extremely dark times for Israel as violence and wickedness are prevalent. Habakkuk pleads for divine intervention in Habakkuk 1:2-4. God answers that he will bring judgment to Israel by means of the Chaldeans (1:5-11).

1081,Ezekiel 4:6,Ezekiel Completes Lying on Right Side for Forty Days,"Bible scholars have had great difficulty explaining the meaning of the text regarding Ezekiel lying on his side a total of 430 days. It is clear from Ezekiel 4:5-6 that each day represents the number of years of Israel’s iniquity. It is clear that the siege of Jerusalem will come 430 years from some previously unstated event. Ezekiel begins to lie on his left side on October 25 in 532 BC. The battle for Jerusalem begins on this December date in 527 BC, four years later. If we use the numbered years in Scripture and 965 BC as the year of the start of Solomon’s Temple, the previous event (430 years) to the Jerusalem attack becomes obvious. On Friday, September 27 – Tishri 15 in 957 BC, the Feast of Tabernacles begins. On this same day, Solomon brings the Ark into the completed Temple and has a Dedication ceremony, according to 2 Chronicles 7:9. Four hundred and twenty-eight years and 93 days from this Dedication ceremony, the battle for Jerusalem would begin, according to 2 Kings 25:1 and Ezekiel 24:1. The start date for the battle of Jerusalem is Sunday, December 29 - Tevet 10 in 529 BC. Less than three years later, the battle for Jerusalem would be over on Monday, July 21 – Av 7 in 526 BC.

Even though the feud between the Agagites and Benjamites was almost a thousand years old, the hostility ran deep. Mordecai was a Benjamite and descendant of King Saul. Haman was an Agagite and descendent of the Amalekites who were defeated in one of the early battles at the start of the Exodus (Exodus 7:8-16). When King Saul was ordered to eliminate the Amalekites in 1 Samuel 15:2-3, he disobeyed and allowed King Agag to live. Samuel had to hack Agag to pieces in Gilgal (1 Samuel 15:32-33) to demonstrate God’s anger toward King Saul for his disobedience.

These verses, and others from Zechariah and Daniel, present serious challenges to many dates found in current Bible chronology. Current Bible chronology insists that the temple is completed around 515 BC in the sixth year of Darius (Ezra 6:15). This assumption would mean that this event is happening about 520 BC. Zerubbabel, Jeshua and Ezra are also present at the Dedication Ceremony of the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Wall in Nehemiah 12:1. This Dedication happens in 445 BC, according to many current Bible chronologies, when the Jerusalem Wall is restored at the end of the Babylonian Exile. It does not seem reasonable that these three men are present at two events nearly seventy-five years apart.

1219,Nehemiah 8:1-12,Ezra Reads The Law From Morning to Midday,"This is a very important occasion in the history of Israel. The first day of Tishri is designated as the Feast of Trumpets according to Leviticus 23:23-25. Leviticus makes it clear that this is a Sabbath-rest and no work is to be done. Leviticus 23:32 makes it clear that this day is a Friday since Tishri 10 falls on a Sunday and is the Day of Atonement. This means that two days in a row are to be treated as a Saturday Sabbath. Deuteronomy 31:10-13 requires that there is to be a reading from the Law every seven years. This was the first time since the Exile that this law regarding the Feasts had been followed. The people stood from morning to midday, about three to four hours. During this reading, the Scribes and Levites on the platform explained the meaning of the text.\p The footnotes in the MacArthur Study Bible for Nehemiah 8:1, and most commentaries of this type, date this event around 445 BC instead of 455 BC. The reasoning is that Ezra had arrived in Jerusalem thirteen years earlier, in 458 BC, in the seventh year of the reign of King Artaxerxes (Ezra 7:8). This was now the twentieth year of his reign. This is the first mention of Ezra in the Book of Nehemiah.\p As previously mentioned in the commentary for Haggai 1:12-15 and Ezra 5:1-2, the mention of the presence of Jeshua in 8:7 raises a serious Bible chronology problem. Is this the same Jeshua who attended the Dedication Ceremony in 520 BC which occurred four years before the Temple was completed? The Temple was completed on Adar 3 according to Ezra 6:15 in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius. The year was 516 to 515 BC according to most study Bibles and commentaries. Adar is the month prior to the month of Nisan. On the first day of the month of Nisan, Ezra leaves Babylon and arrives four months later, according to Ezra 7:7-9. It appears from the text that Ezra left the month after the Temple was completed. Current Bible chronology inserts fifty-seven years between the completion of the Temple (515 BC to 516 BC) and the return of Ezra in the year 458 BC. No explanation from Scripture, or any other source, could be found by the author of this research for this insertion of over fifty-seven years into the Biblical text.",DIS,331,3659,1332210,Friday,September,13,Tishri,1,455,BC,Friday,April,9,Nisan,20,453,BC,L,173,1556068.75,0,5,3.79999999999995,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can be speculated that Simon may have been someone who had been healed by Jesus. Martha and Mary are apparently serving the meal for Simon. Mary, the sister of Lazarus, anoints the feet of Jesus, according to John 12:3. Matthew 26:7 and Mark 14:3 say that she also anointed the head of Jesus. She used very costly fragrant oil and breaks the alabaster flask, according to Mark 14:3. According to the footnotes for Mark 14:5 in the MacArthur Study Bible, the oil was valued at about 300 denarii. This amount would be about a year’s wages for a common laborer. It was apparently common to pay one denarii as a day’s wage. The alabaster flask containing the oil probably came from Egypt and would have also been very expensive. Many of the disciples object to this extravagance. This protest was led by Judas, the treasurer of the group. Matthew 26:12-13 echoes the response of Jesus in Mark 14:8-9 when he says, “She has done what she could. She has come beforehand to anoint My body for burial. Assuredly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told as a memorial to her”. Another woman anoints Jesus’ feet at a Pharisee’s house named Simon at a different time and location, as recorded in Luke 7:36-39.

It seems almost miraculous that no authority physically attempted to stop Jesus from doing the Temple cleansing on either occasion. On the first occasion, His “authority” is questioned. Jesus uses the second cleansing as a time to start two days of teaching and healing in the Temple. When Jesus cleanses the Temple, he quotes the prophecies of Isaiah 56:7 and Jeremiah 7:11. Isaiah 56:7 reads: “For My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations”.

104,Matthew 26:14-19; Mark 14:10-16; Luke 22:3-13,Judas Plans to Betray Jesus as Disciples Prepare Passover Meal,"These events associated with the betrayal of Jesus by Judas Iscariot and the preparation of the Last Supper meal, are events that occur simultaneously on Thursday of Easter Week. The betrayal by Judas probably happens early in the daylight hours of Thursday, Nisan 13 before noon of that day. Probably sometime after noon, the disciples get directions about the evening Passover meal that we know as the Last Supper. On this day, the Passover Lamb is killed and prepared between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., before the start of the eight days of Passover starting on Nisan 14. It may have been a Galilean custom to celebrate the main Passover meal at the beginning of the Hebrew day at evening. It appears that other Jews would celebrate the main Passover meal in the late afternoon of Nisan 14, near the end of the day. It is also possible that both meals were heavily celebrated on Nisan 14 Passover. In Mark 14:12, the disciples ask Jesus, “Where do you want us to go and prepare, that you may eat the Passover?” When the disciples ask this question, it is still the daytime portion of Thursday and Nisan 13. Even though Nisan 14 will officially not start until 6:00 p.m. that evening, Nisan 14 is given as the date because the date in Scripture is given on the start of the Hebrew day at evening, even though most of the day will actually occur the next day on a solar calendar.",Sol-Passover,197,4143,1508252,Thursday,May,1,Iyar,14,30,AD,Thursday,April,4,Nisan,13,30,AD,N,166,1732110.75,0,1,100.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
105,Matthew 26:20-30; Mark 14:17-27; Luke 22:14-30; John Chapters 13 & 14,Jesus Celebrates Last Passover Supper With Disciples,"The exact dating of the Passover meal, often referred to as the Last Supper, is critical to understanding the historic and theological implications of this event. At this point, in the discussion of the events of Easter Week, it may be helpful to elaborate on the connection of the Day of Preparation to the Feast of Unleavened Bread, mentioned in John 19:14. The footnotes in the MacArthur Study Bible, related to Matthew 26:17 and Mark 14:12, are very helpful in sorting this out. There seems to be some confusion about the day of the week of the Last Supper and in some cases the day of the week of the crucifixion. I have heard more than one person say that the Last Supper and the time when Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane are events that occur on Thursday. Assuming the Last Supper events happened before midnight, a reasonable assumption, the day of the week would be Thursday only on a solar calendar that measures the days from midnight to midnight. On a Hebrew calendar, these events are clearly on a Friday assuming the events happened after 6:00 p.m. which is also a reasonable assumption. Some historians have suggested that the Galileans celebrated Nisan 14 most heavily at the beginning of the Hebrew day at the evening start of Passover. This would be the time of the events associated with the Last Supper. Others may have had their main Passover Feast at the end of the day ending around 3:00 p.m. at the time Jesus died on the cross. After 3:00 p.m. on Nisan 14 is the time when Jews would begin preparation for the events called the Feast of Unleavened Bread. This latter part of the day, on Nisan 14 Passover, is the time when all the food from the Passover meal is cleared out and no yeast or leavened products are allowed to remain in the home. The Feast of Unleavened Bread is also called “Passover week” and goes for seven days from Nisan 15 through Nisan 21. From this clearly stated Friday Nisan 14 Passover date of the crucifixion, all of Earth’s history can be accurately measured and dated on any computer generated calendar using the Julian day number of 1,732,111.75.",SDIS,198,4143,1508253,Friday,May,2,Iyar,15,30,AD,Friday,April,5,Nisan,14,30,AD,N,167,1732111.75,0,1,100.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106,Matthew 27:29-56; Mark 15:22-37; Luke 23:26-46; John 19:17-30,Jesus is Crucified on Passover,"The crucifixion of Jesus, on the Nisan 14 Passover date in 30 AD, is probably the most important calendar date in history connecting the non-solar 364-Day calendar of the Old Testament and the solar calendars in use today. Obviously, the theological significance of what happened on this day is of much greater importance than the precise monumental mathematical calendar implications found in the Biblical text of both the New and Old Testament. There are numerous books, commentaries and films that accurately portray the event of the crucifixion of Jesus as the clearest example of God’s loving grace. It is God who provides an acceptable “Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world”, according to John 1:29. In this part of the Bible Timeline research, the author wishes to focus attention on some aspects of this important day in history that are often overlooked.  \pIt is very clear from Scripture that there is a three hour period of darkness between noon and 3:00 p.m. during the event of the crucifixion. This period of darkness is mentioned in three of the four Gospels. The historians Thallus (around 52 BC), Phlegon (around 137 AD), and Africanus (around 221 AD) make reference to a three hour period of darkness during the nineteenth year of Tiberius in 30 AD. They attempt to claim it was some unusual form of solar eclipse that lasted about three hours. They recognized this was a difficult explanation since the moon is opposite the sun during the Nisan 14 Passover on April 5 in 30 AD on the Gregorian calendar. Phlegon writes that there was, “the greatest eclipse of the sun and that it became night in the sixth hour of the day (i.e., noon) so that the stars even appeared in the heavens. There was a great earthquake in Bithynia, and many things overturned in Nicaea”. This was clearly not explained by the sun being covered up by the moon or clouds. The sun is clearly not in the sky for about a three hour period of time. Africanus also recognized that there was no logical link between an eclipse, an earthquake, the tearing of the Temple Veil, and the bodily resurrections, described in Matthew 27:51-54, Mark 15:38-39, and Luke 23:44-47. The earthquake and other events seem to be a direct fulfillment of Amos 8:8-9, even though a large earthquake happened a few years later (est. 760 BC), according to Amos 1:1 and Zechariah 14:5. \pThe events following the death of Jesus are a very clear commentary by God on the events of that day. Clearly the world was put in the darkness of God’s Judgment. The statement by Jesus, shortly before His death, that “it is finished” is a statement much like a stamp on a receipt that reads, “Paid in Full”. The penalty for sin had been completely satisfied and no more sacrifices would be needed. The events recorded after His deaths are a preview of a future Day of Judgment. The bodily resurrections of others on Sunday, besides Jesus, are a preview of coming attractions of the Day of Judgment. This is followed by the eternal bodily resurrections for those who recognize Jesus as Lord and Savior. \pThe Friday, May 2 – Iyar 15 date of the crucifixion in 30 AD is exactly 1474 years after Israel arrives at the Wilderness of Sin on this same date in 1445 BC, as recorded in Exodus 16:1. This date in 1445 BC is just four days after the Crossing of the Red Sea. Two days after this date in 1445 BC, on Sunday, May 4 – Iyar 17, Israel would eat the first manna from heaven, as recorded in Exodus 16:13-21.
