Zacharias encounters the Angel Gabriel who tells him that his wife, Elizabeth would conceive John the Baptist.

29,"Peter Confesses Jesus as ""Son of the Living God""",EST,EST,,"It is important to note that the estimated date, that Peter makes this important “confession”, is Nisan 17 on the 364-Day calendar. Nisan 17 is the date that the Ark comes to rest in the mountains of Ararat in 2457 BC. This date is exactly 1,473 years after Israel makes first camp at Succoth in 1445 BC, starting the Exodus. One year after Peter’s Confession of Jesus as, “the Christ, the Son of the living God”, Nisan 17 on a solar calendar is the evening of the resurrection when Jesus meets with His disciples, when Thomas is absent. This is described in John 20:19-23.",
29,"Jesus Says Judas Iscariot is a ""Devil""",Sol-Passover,Sol-Passover,,"This portion of the Biblical text emphasizes that it is Jesus who chose the disciples and emphasizes His sovereignty. The MacArthur Study Bible is very helpful in accurately assessing the true character of Judas and the connection to the influence of Satan. Judas is not just “a devil”. John 13:27 makes it very clear that “Satan entered him”, referring to Judas. Some writers have mistakenly suggested that Judas was just a misguided visionary who was trying to force Jesus into starting His Kingdom. The evil heart of Judas was clearly involved in his betrayal of Jesus.",
29,Herod Antipas Thinks Jesus is John the Baptist Risen,SDIS,SDIS,,"In this part of Scripture, even Herod Antipas recognizes that Jesus has some type of supernatural power. Mark 6:14-16 outlines how Jesus was seen by many Jews as Elijah. It was expected that Elijah would return just before the arrival of the Messiah. Others saw Jesus as a special messenger, like one of the Prophets from the Old Testament. Jesus was clearly seen by many Jews as “special”, but many did not seem to conclude that he was the expected Messiah.",
29,Nisan 14 Passover in 29 AD,SDIS,SDIS,,"Nisan 14 Passover is the Solar Date from Creation (SDFC) when we look at events in the New Testament, since we are now dealing with a solar calendar. Nisan 14 Passover always falls on April 5 on the Gregorian calendar in a non-leap year. Nisan 14 falls on April 3 in a leap year.",
30,Jesus in Bethany Six Days Before Passover 30 AD,SDIS,SDIS,,"It is likely that Lazarus had been raised from the dead just a few days prior to this event. The Jews are now plotting to kill Jesus and Lazarus. The raising of Lazarus was probably the ""last straw"" that triggered the anger of the Jewish leaders to plot the murder of Jesus.",
30,Martha Serves Supper & Mary Anoints Jesus' Feet,SDIS,SDIS,,"This evening meal, at the house of Simon the Leper, in Bethany begins the events on Sunday on the Hebrew calendar. It can be speculated that Simon may have been someone who had been healed by Jesus. Martha and Mary are apparently serving the meal for Simon. Mary, the sister of Lazarus, anoints the feet of Jesus, according to John 12:3. Matthew 26:7 and Mark 14:3 say that she also anointed the head of Jesus. She used very costly fragrant oil and breaks the alabaster flask, according to Mark 14:3. According to the footnotes for Mark 14:5 in the MacArthur Study Bible, the oil was valued at about 300 denarii. This amount would be about a year’s wages for a common laborer. It was apparently common to pay one denarii as a day’s wage. The alabaster flask containing the oil probably came from Egypt and would have also been very expensive. Many of the disciples object to this extravagance. This protest was led by Judas, the treasurer of the group. Matthew 26:12-13 echoes the response of Jesus in Mark 14:8-9 when he says, “She has done what she could. She has come beforehand to anoint My body for burial. Assuredly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told as a memorial to her”. Another woman anoints Jesus’ feet at a Pharisee’s house named Simon at a different time and location, as recorded in Luke 7:36-39. On this second occasion, Jesus tells the Parable of the Two Debtors found in Luke 7:40-50.",
30,Chief Priests Plot to Kill Lazarus and Jesus,SDIS,SDIS,,The Chief Priests come to see the recently raised Lazarus. They decide to plot the murder of both Jesus and Lazarus. These events happen during the daylight hours following the events of the previous evening at supper when Mary anointed the feet of Jesus. The next day would be Nisan 10 and the start of the Feast of Passover.,
30,The Triumphal Entry of Jesus Into Jerusalem,SDIS,SDIS,,"This event happens on Monday, Nisan 10 on the Gregorian-Hebrew solar calendar and is often mistakenly called “Palm Sunday”. On the 364-Day calendar, the date of this event is Monday, April 28 – Iyar 11 in 30 AD. This event, on Nisan 10 of the solar calendar, starts the Feast of Passover. On this day the Sacrificial Lamb is chosen to be sacrificed four days later. On this day in 30 AD, Jesus would be hailed as a Prophet from Galilee (Matthew 21:11). On Friday, the day of Passover just four days later, many of these same people would be saying, “Crucify him”, according to Mark 15:13-14, Luke 23:21, and John 19:15. On this same Monday, Iyar 11 date in 1445 BC, God parts the Red Sea at PiHahiroth. Four days after crossing the Red Sea, “on the fifteenth day of the second month after they departed from the land of Egypt”, the nation of Israel makes camp in the Wilderness of Sin, according to Exodus 16:1.",
30,Jesus Cleanses the Temple in Jerusalem,SDIS,SDIS,,"Jesus had cleansed the Temple during Passover in the first year of His public ministry in 27 AD, as recorded in John 2:14-17. It seems almost miraculous that no authority physically attempted to stop Jesus from doing the Temple cleansing on either occasion. On the first occasion, His “authority” is questioned. Jesus uses the second cleansing as a time to start two days of teaching and healing in the Temple. When Jesus cleanses the Temple, he quotes the prophecies of Isaiah 56:7 and Jeremiah 7:11. Isaiah 56:7 reads: “For My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations”. Jeremiah 7:11 quotes God’s questioning rebuke to the nation of Israel: “Has this house, which is called by My name, become a den of thieves in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it,” says the Lord”.",
30,Jesus Teaches All Day in the Temple,SDIS,SDIS,,"After clearing out the moneychangers and other merchants from the Temple the day before, Jesus spends most of Wednesday teaching. Jesus basically has the Temple all to himself and uses His time to do a great deal of teaching. Jesus is confronted by the Pharisees and His authority is unsuccessfully challenged. Jesus is critical of the Pharisee’s false traditions and sternly condemns them publically. Jesus teaches and explains many parables. Jesus clearly displays His teaching authority as being from God. Jesus also shows his flawless understanding of God’s Word. On this day in history, the Messiah is the centerpiece on display in the Jerusalem Temple.",
30,Judas Plans to Betray Jesus as Disciples Prepare Passover Meal,Sol-Passover,Sol-Passover,,"These events associated with the betrayal of Jesus by Judas Iscariot and the preparation of the Last Supper meal, are events that occur simultaneously on Thursday of Easter Week. The betrayal by Judas probably happens early in the daylight hours of Thursday, Nisan 13 before noon of that day. Probably sometime after noon, the disciples get directions about the evening Passover meal that we know as the Last Supper. On this day, the Passover Lamb is killed and prepared between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., before the start of the eight days of Passover starting on Nisan 14. It may have been a Galilean custom to celebrate the main Passover meal at the beginning of the Hebrew day at evening. It appears that other Jews would celebrate the main Passover meal in the late afternoon of Nisan 14, near the end of the day. It is also possible that both meals were heavily celebrated on Nisan 14 Passover. In Mark 14:12, the disciples ask Jesus, “Where do you want us to go and prepare, that you may eat the Passover?” When the disciples ask this question, it is still the daytime portion of Thursday and Nisan 13. Even though Nisan 14 will officially not start until 6:00 p.m. that evening, Nisan 14 is given as the date because the date in Scripture is given on the start of the Hebrew day at evening, even though most of the day will actually occur the next day on a solar calendar.",
30,Jesus Celebrates Last Passover Supper With Disciples,SDIS,SDIS,,"The exact dating of the Passover meal, often referred to as the Last Supper, is critical to understanding the historic and theological implications of this event. At this point, in the discussion of the events of Easter Week, it may be helpful to elaborate on the connection of the Day of Preparation to the Feast of Unleavened Bread, mentioned in John 19:14. The footnotes in the MacArthur Study Bible, related to Matthew 26:17 and Mark 14:12, are very helpful in sorting this out. There seems to be some confusion about the day of the week of the Last Supper and in some cases the day of the week of the crucifixion. I have heard more than one person say that the Last Supper and the time when Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane are events that occur on Thursday. Assuming the Last Supper events happened before midnight, a reasonable assumption, the day of the week would be Thursday only on a solar calendar that measures the days from midnight to midnight. On a Hebrew calendar, these events are clearly on a Friday assuming the events happened after 6:00 p.m. which is also a reasonable assumption. Some historians have suggested that the Galileans celebrated Nisan 14 most heavily at the beginning of the Hebrew day at the evening start of Passover. This would be the time of the events associated with the Last Supper. Others may have had their main Passover Feast at the end of the day ending around 3:00 p.m. at the time Jesus died on the cross. After 3:00 p.m. on Nisan 14 is the time when Jews would begin preparation for the events called the Feast of Unleavened Bread. This latter part of the day, on Nisan 14 Passover, is the time when all the food from the Passover meal is cleared out and no yeast or leavened products are allowed to remain in the home. The Feast of Unleavened Bread is also called “Passover week” and goes for seven days from Nisan 15 through Nisan 21. From this clearly stated Friday Nisan 14 Passover date of the crucifixion, all of Earth’s history can be accurately measured and dated on any computer generated calendar using the Julian day number of 1,732,111.75.",
30,Jesus is Crucified on Passover,SDIS,SDIS,,"The crucifixion of Jesus, on the Nisan 14 Passover date in 30 AD, is probably the most important calendar date in history connecting the non-solar 364-Day calendar of the Old Testament and the solar calendars in use today. Obviously, the theological significance of what happened on this day is of much greater importance than the precise monumental mathematical calendar implications found in the Biblical text of both the New and Old Testament. There are numerous books, commentaries and films that accurately portray the event of the crucifixion of Jesus as the clearest example of God’s loving grace. It is God who provides an acceptable “Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world”, according to John 1:29. In this part of the Bible Timeline research, the author wishes to focus attention on some aspects of this important day in history that are often overlooked. \pIt is very clear from Scripture that there is a three hour period of darkness between noon and 3:00 p.m. during the event of the crucifixion. This period of darkness is mentioned in three of the four Gospels. The historians Thallus (around 52 BC), Phlegon (around 137 AD), and Africanus (around 221 AD) make reference to a three hour period of darkness during the nineteenth year of Tiberius in 30 AD. They attempt to claim it was some unusual form of solar eclipse that lasted about three hours. They recognized this was a difficult explanation since the moon is opposite the sun during the Nisan 14 Passover on April 5 in 30 AD on the Gregorian calendar. Phlegon writes that there was, “the greatest eclipse of the sun and that it became night in the sixth hour of the day (i.e., noon) so that the stars even appeared in the heavens. There was a great earthquake in Bithynia, and many things overturned in Nicaea”. This was clearly not explained by the sun being covered up by the moon or clouds. The sun is clearly not in the sky for about a three hour period of time. Africanus also recognized that there was no logical link between an eclipse, an earthquake, the tearing of the Temple Veil, and the bodily resurrections, described in Matthew 27:51-54, Mark 15:38-39, and Luke 23:44-47. The earthquake and other events seem to be a direct fulfillment of Amos 8:8-9, even though a large earthquake happened a few years later (est. 760 BC), according to Amos 1:1 and Zechariah 14:5. \pThe events following the death of Jesus are a very clear commentary by God on the events of that day. Clearly the world was put in the darkness of God’s Judgment. The statement by Jesus, shortly before His death, that “it is finished” is a statement much like a stamp on a receipt that reads, “Paid in Full”. The penalty for sin had been completely satisfied and no more sacrifices would be needed. The events recorded after His deaths are a preview of a future Day of Judgment. The bodily resurrections of others on Sunday, besides Jesus, are a preview of coming attractions of the Day of Judgment. This is followed by the eternal bodily resurrections for those who recognize Jesus as Lord and Savior. \pThe Friday, May 2 – Iyar 15 date of the crucifixion in 30 AD is exactly 1474 years after Israel arrives at the Wilderness of Sin on this same date in 1445 BC, as recorded in Exodus 16:1. This date in 1445 BC is just four days after the Crossing of the Red Sea. Two days after this date in 1445 BC, on Sunday, May 4 – Iyar 17, Israel would eat the first manna from heaven, as recorded in Exodus 16:13-21. It is also important to note that the same Hebrew dates in 30 AD happen two days apart going from Nisan 14 on the Gregorian-Hebrew calendar to Nisan 16 on the Hebrew secular calendar. In like manner, the same date in 30 AD on the Gregorian calendar is two days later on the Julian calendar.",

455,Questioning Regarding Pagan Wives Ends,DIS,DIS,,"At the end of three months, Ezra the Priest ends the questioning of the Fathers' households regarding the issue of the pagan wives taken during the Babylonian captivity. The questioning involved at least 113 men, listed in Ezra 10:18-44, who had married pagan women and many had children from these marriages. Only four leaders, who opposed the attempt to be separated from their pagan wives, are mentioned in Ezra 10:15. Many in Israel say that they will separate from their pagan wives, according to Ezra 10:12. The problem does not seem to be solved until Nehemiah addresses Israel at the Feast of Tabernacles in 455 BC. Nehemiah’s handling of this difficult problem is recorded in Chapters 9 and 10 of the Book of Nehemiah.",
455,King Artaxerxes Lets Nehemiah Leave For Jerusalem,EDIS,EDIS,,"This event happens in the month of Nisan in the 20th year of the reign of King Artaxerxes.

455,Nehemiah Goes to the Governors Beyond the River,EST,EST,,"Nehemiah goes to the Governors around Judah to inform them of his status as a Governor to Judah. Under the protection of Persian King Artaxerxes, he enjoyed safe travel among enemies and was able to get the building materials needed to repair the Jerusalem Wall. The time it would take Nehemiah, to journey from Persia to Jerusalem and make preparations to rebuild the Jerusalem Wall, would be a little more than three months.",
455,Sanballat and Tobiah Upset by Nehemiah's Mission,EST,EST,,"These two enemies of Israel, Sanballat and Tobiah, are upset that Nehemiah has come to aid the Jews in Jerusalem. The mention of Sanballat in this part of the text is extremely important in dating this period of history. Sanballat was the Governor of Samaria and his sons were very active in politics. Coins have been found with Sanballat’s image on them from around 420 BC. Elephantine Papyri claim that Sanballat was the Governor of Samaria around 407 BC. This would make it impossible for him and Tobiah to resist the completion of the Temple foundation in 515 BC instead of 468 BC as this research claims.",

455,Nehemiah Inspires Jewish Leaders to Build the Wall,EST,EST,,Nehemiah showed great spiritual leadership in appealing to Israel’s sense of pride as being the people of God. The destruction of Jerusalem had brought great shame to the people of Israel and cast some doubt on God’s protective character. Nehemiah assured the nation that God would protect them in rebuilding the Wall and Jerusalem. Nehemiah also assured the people that King Artaxerxes had given a written document for protection and supplies for this rebuilding.,
455,Nehemiah's Enemies Mock Plans to Build the Wall,EST,EST,,Sanballat and Tobiah opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the Wall which gave some power back to the nation of Israel as it regrouped after the Babylonian Exile. These two men were probably supportive of the opposition described in Ezra 4:7-23.,
455,Eliashib Begins Building the Sheep Gate,DIS,DIS,,"This is the first day of fifty-two days needed to complete the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Wall under Nehemiah's direction. This date is calculated from the date the Wall is completed on Sunday, September 8−Elul 25 as recorded in Nehemiah 6:15. The fourth day of rebuilding the Jerusalem Wall, Monday, July 21−Av 7, would mark the seventy-first anniversary of the first day of the burning of the Jerusalem Temple in 526 BC according to Jeremiah 52:12-16. On this day in 526 BC, the Jerusalem Wall was also destroyed by the Babylonian army. The fourth day of rebuilding the Jerusalem Wall would trigger the beginning of Daniel’s Seventy Weeks prophecy recorded in Daniel 9:20-27. This current date of Friday, July 18−Av 4, marked the very day, ""when seventy years are completed"" that Jeremiah spoke of in Jeremiah 25:12 (70 years plus 359 days).",

This date is the birth of Jesus and is exactly 4,096 solar years from Day #7 of Creation in 4,101 BC. According to Scripture, there are 4,096 years from Creation Week until the birth of Jesus. This July 21 – Av 7 date also marks “seventy completed years” (Jeremiah 25:11-12) from the time the Temple starts burning in 526 BC, according to 2 Kings 25:8-9.",

455,Ezra Reads The Law From Morning to Midday,DIS,DIS,,"This is a very important occasion in the history of Israel. The first day of Tishri is designated as the Feast of Trumpets according to Leviticus 23:23-25. Leviticus makes it clear that this is a Sabbath-rest and no work is to be done. Leviticus 23:32 makes it clear that this day is a Friday since Tishri 10 falls on a Sunday and is the Day of Atonement. This means that two days in a row are to be treated as a Saturday Sabbath. Deuteronomy 31:10-13 requires that there is to be a reading from the Law every seven years. This was the first time since the Exile that this law regarding the Feasts had been followed. The people stood from morning to midday, about three to four hours. During this reading, the Scribes and Levites on the platform explained the meaning of the text.\p The footnotes in the MacArthur Study Bible for Nehemiah 8:1, and most commentaries of this type, date this event around 445 BC instead of 455 BC. The reasoning is that Ezra had arrived in Jerusalem thirteen years earlier, in 458 BC, in the seventh year of the reign of King Artaxerxes (Ezra 7:8). This was now the twentieth year of his reign. This is the first mention of Ezra in the Book of Nehemiah.\p As previously mentioned in the commentary for Haggai 1:12-15 and Ezra 5:1-2, the mention of the presence of Jeshua in 8:7 raises a serious Bible chronology problem. Is this the same Jeshua who attended the Dedication Ceremony in 520 BC which occurred four years before the Temple was completed? The Temple was completed on Adar 3 according to Ezra 6:15 in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius. The year was 516 to 515 BC according to most study Bibles and commentaries. Adar is the month prior to the month of Nisan. On the first day of the month of Nisan, Ezra leaves Babylon and arrives four months later, according to Ezra 7:7-9. It appears from the text that Ezra left the month after the Temple was completed. Current Bible chronology inserts fifty-seven years between the completion of the Temple (515 BC to 516 BC) and the return of Ezra in the year 458 BC. No explanation from Scripture, or any other source, could be found by the author of this research for this insertion of over fifty-seven years into the Biblical text.",

It has been seventy years and about five months since the destruction of Jerusalem in July of 526 BC. It has been almost thirteen years since the Temple was restored. Nehemiah prays for God to forgive Israel and wishes to return to Jerusalem. Nehemiah may have heard about the problem facing Israel regarding the pagan wives and children that had returned to Jerusalem. Ezra the Priest had addressed this issue publically in Jerusalem just four days earlier. In one week the questioning of the husbands of pagan wives would begin. The issue of pagan wives represented a clear act of Israel’s disobedience to God’s clear directions. Nehemiah is asking for God’s forgiveness and needs God’s guidance. He is about to appointed by King Artaxerxes as Governor and will be returning to Jerusalem.,

Modern Bible chronology usually dates this event, of the dedication of the Temple, as happening in the year 515 BC. This erroneous date is partially created with the start of the Babylonian Exile in 586 BC instead of 526 BC. For more information, see notes in this Chapter on Haggai 1:12-15 and Ezra 5:1-2.",

468,Israel Agrees to Put Away Pagan Wives of Babylonian Captivity,DIS,DIS,,"This event happens on the twentieth day of the ninth month. Many, but not all men in Israel publically agree to put away (separated themselves) their pagan wives and children. Israel’s leaders agree to meet on the first day of the tenth month to start the three month questioning of Jews with pagan wives.

470,Zechariah Proclaims Captivity Result of Disobedience,DIS,DIS,,"Zechariah refers to ""those seventy years"" in verse 7:5. He is referring to the seventy-six years that have passed since the first deportation in 546 BC that included Daniel the Prophet. Zechariah’s message to the nation of Israel is very clear that they have suffered greatly due to their disobedience to God. This dated prophecy of Zechariah is extremely important in dating many of the events during the last fifteen years of the Babylonian Exile. This event happens on the fourth day of the ninth month in the fourth year of Darius (son of Ahasuerus). According to Daniel 9:1, this Darius is also the son of King Ahasuerus. As previously stated, this Darius, believed to be the brother of Artaxerxes, begins his reign in 474 BC. This King Darius is not to be confused with Darius the Mede (another name for King Ahasuerus) or Darius the Persian who follows the fifty-one year reign of King Artaxerxes that ends in 424 BC. This event happens two year after the decree by Darius. This event is also two years before the Temple is restored in 468 BC.",

471,Zechariah's Vision of the Horses,DIS,DIS,,This event happens on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month in the second year of Darius (son of Ahasuerus). This important date in Scripture and the connection to Darius (Son of Ahasuerus) is a key to accurately dating many Exile events.,
471,"God Promises Comfort After ""these seventy years""",DIS,DIS,,"“These seventy years” refers to the seventy plus years since the first deportation with Daniel. This event happened in 546 BC and is recorded in Daniel 1:1-7. These same seventy plus years are mentioned in Zechariah 7:4. These 70 years are often confused with the 70 years mentioned by the Prophet Jeremiah. The seventy “completed” years of Jeremiah 25:11-12 and 29:10 are fulfilled on the fourth day of the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Wall on Monday, July 21-Av 7 in 455 BC. The rebuilding of the Jerusalem Wall starts almost 71 years after the Temple starts burning in 526 BC. This date at the end of the Babylonian Exile, when the Wall starts being repaired, starts the 483 years and forty weeks of Daniel’s Seventy Weeks prophecy.",
471,Darius Issues Decree to Search Archives of Cyrus,EST,EST,,"In response to Tattenai’s letter protesting the continued rebuilding of Jerusalem and the Wall around it, Darius issues a decree to search the archives of King Cyrus. The decree of Cyrus issued in his first year as King of Babylon (488 BC) is found and upheld by Darius (son of Ahasuerus). According to Daniel 5:31, the year that Cyrus conquers Babylon is the same year that Darius the Mede, also known by the name Ahasuerus, ""received the kingdom"" of Babylon from King Cyrus II, the grandson of Cyrus I.",
471,Darius Allows Temple Work to Continue With Decree,EST,EST,,"Darius issues a decree that funds the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple and Wall. King Darius also promises a death penalty for anyone who opposes the Jews attempts at the restoration of Jerusalem. Once this decree is issued, no more is heard from the Prophet Daniel. Daniel seems to live long enough to hear the decree but does not get to see the results. This decree clarifies Ezra 4:24 in the second year of the reign of Darius.",
472,Haggai Rebukes Israel for not Rebuilding the Temple,DIS,DIS,,This event happens on the first day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius (son of Ahasuerus). This is a critical date and year in calculating events during the Exile.,
472,Haggai Gives Zerubbabel Command From the Lord,DIS,DIS,,"This event happens on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius (son of Ahasuerus). Zerubbabel and Jeshua ""rose up and began to build the house of God which is in Jerusalem"", according to Ezra 5:2. These verses, and others from Zechariah and Daniel, present serious challenges to many dates found in current Bible chronology. Current Bible chronology insists that the temple is completed around 515 BC in the sixth year of Darius (Ezra 6:15). This assumption would mean that this event is happening about 520 BC. Zerubbabel, Jeshua and Ezra are also present at the Dedication Ceremony of the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Wall in Nehemiah 12:1. This Dedication happens in 445 BC, according to many current Bible chronologies, when the Jerusalem Wall is restored at the end of the Babylonian Exile. It does not seem reasonable that these three men are present at two events nearly seventy-five years apart. This research concludes that the start of the Exile and Fall of Jerusalem happened in 526 BC instead of 586 BC. The end of the Exile is in 455 BC instead of 445 BC. This dates the start of Daniels 70 Weeks (483 years + 285 days) on July 21–Av 25 of 455 BC and ending on the solar date of the Crucifixion on Friday, April 5−Nisan 14 of 30 AD.",

The accurate dating of this event is critical to understanding the reigns of the Kings of Israel and Persia. The dating of this event gives clarification to the dated events found in the Books of Haggai and Zechariah. The dating of this event is critical to establishing accurate dates for the Fall of Jerusalem in 526 BC (not 588 BC). This date also helps establish the completion of the rebuilding of the Temple in 468 BC instead of 515 BC as is currently claimed by almost every major Bible chronology.,

Daniel also realizes that the ""seventy completed years"" of Jeremiah 25:12 are about nineteen years ahead in the future. This famous prophecy of Daniel would begin with the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Wall and the City of Jerusalem (9:25) in the month of Av (July) in 455 BC.

475,Letters to King Ahasuerus and King Artaxerxes Opposed Rebuilding in Jerusalem,EST,EST,,Ezra 4:6 mentions an earlier letter of opposition to the rebuilding going on in Jerusalem to King Ahasuerus in about 486 BC. The letter mentioned here is to King Artaxerxes in the first year of his reign in 475 BC. The Book of Ezra is probably written during the time of these events.,
475,Letter From King Artaxerxes Stops Rebuilding in Jerusalem,EST,EST,,"The rebuilding of the Temple and Jerusalem was stopped until the second year of Darius, son of Ahasuerus. According to Ezra 6:6-12, King Darius allows the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the Temple to continue a little over three years later in 471 BC. It is believed by this researcher that King Ahasuerus was also the father of Artaxerxes. During this year, Cambyses II dies in Egypt and King Ahasuerus is assassinated. Many historians date the death of King Ahasuerus in 465 BC. This latter date seems unlikely since there is no further mention of him in Scripture after this year. King Ahasuerus is also known in history as Darius Hystaspes. Artaxerxes comes to power and is soon joined by Darius who returns from Egypt after the death of Cambyses II about nine months later. Darius is probably the brother of Artaxerxes by a different mother.",

476,Haman Gets Decree to Kill the Jews in Month of Adar,EDIS,EDIS,,This event happens in the month of Nisan in the twelfth year of the reign of King Ahasuerus. Haman is given the right to kill the Jews in the month of Adar which is eleven months away. Once a Persian King issues a decree it cannot be taken back. Haman thinks he has promoted himself in the eyes of the King. His plan will backfire and he will be dead in less than three months.,

Even though it is eleven months away, panic and fear spread among the Jews. There was great mourning, weeping, fasting and wailing. Esther’s maids tell her about the situation and the despair experienced by Mordecai. Mordecai tells the King how Haman had gotten this decree by paying a large sum of money into the King’s treasury. He also sends her a copy of the decree. Mordecai asks Esther to plead the Jews case to the King knowing the King cannot reverse his order. Mordecai seems to believe that he is responsible for the trouble that is being brought by Haman against the Jewish people because of his blatant disrespect for Haman.",

She is going to try and speak with the King even though this may cause her death. In Persia no one could approach the King unless he held out his scepter as a sign that the King could be approached. Esther tells Mordecai that the King has not allowed her to approach for 30 days. Mordecai explained that she would not escape the effects of Haman’s decree if it is allowed to be carried out. She sends a message to Mordecai and the Jews; “if I perish, I perish!”",
476,Esther Asks the King For a Banquet,EDIS,EDIS,,"After fasting and praying for three days Esther prepared herself to approach the King. She puts on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the King’s palace where she would be seen by the King. She probably went to great lengths to look very beautiful and pleasing to the King. King Ahasuerus takes the bait and holds out his royal scepter and said to her, ""What do you wish, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given to you─up to half the kingdom!"" This phrase is an expression of royal hyperbole that was often used by a King but was never intended to be acted upon or taken seriously. She asks if Haman can be invited again to the banquet the next day. She says she has something to ask the King but she wants to wait until the following day. The King was probably very curious as to what she wanted. It appears to Haman that he is going to be honored but Esther is setting a trap that Haman will walk right into. The Book of Esther was probably written during or soon after these events.",
476,Haman Plots to Kill Mordecai,EDIS,EDIS,,"Probably that evening, Haman and his family plot the death of Mordecai. Haman’s hatred and jealousy about Mordecai’s non-submissive attitude has reached the point of an obsession to kill him. Haman’s wife suggests that they build a gallows about 75 feet high to hang or impale Mordecai. The precise form of death has been debated and is somewhat uncertain. The plan clearly calls for Mordecai’s death before the banquet the next day.",

This seems to happen soon after Esther is made Queen. Mordecai is appointed as one of the king’s servants and sits within the king’s gate in a position of honor. Two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, are angry with the king and make plans to assassinate the king. Mordecai became aware of this plot and informed Queen Esther. Queen Esther informed the king of the plot in Mordecai’s name. When the plot was confirmed by an investigation, the two men were hanged. This event was written in the records of the king’s book of chronicles in his presence. At the time, no special honor or recognition was given to Mordecai.",
480,Haman Conspires to Kill the Jews,EDIS,EDIS,,"Shortly after the plot to kill the King is foiled, Haman is appointed to govern the princes who were with him. The servants who sat at the King’s gate were expected to bow down to Haman but Mordecai did not pay him this expected courtesy. Even though the feud between the Agagites and Benjamites was almost a thousand years old, the hostility ran deep. Mordecai was a Benjamite and descendant of King Saul. Haman was an Agagite and descendent of the Amalekites who were defeated in one of the early battles at the start of the Exodus (Exodus 7:8-16). When King Saul was ordered to eliminate the Amalekites in 1 Samuel 15:2-3, he disobeyed and allowed King Agag to live. Samuel had to hack Agag to pieces in Gilgal (1 Samuel 15:32-33) to demonstrate God’s anger toward King Saul for his disobedience. From this point on in Saul’s life, God rejects him as a King and turns his attention David. Haman began to plot the destruction of the Jews in the same way the Amalekites had been almost obliterated as a people.",

The harassment does not end until the second year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, in 473 BC. At this time, Darius issues a decree to allow the rebuilding of the Temple until completed. Many chronologies put this event with Zerubbabel and Jeshua as occurring in 536 BC. Many chronologies place these same individuals with Ezra at the Dedication of the Jerusalem Wall in 445 BC, 91 years later, in the 20th year of Artaxerxes (Neh. 12:1-9).",
486,Adversaries of Judah Send Letter to Ahasuerus,DFC,DFC,,"Ahasuerus is also Darius the Mede, who was appointed King of Babylon in October of 488 BC. Ahasuerus does not stop the rebuilding in Jerusalem in fulfillment of Jeremiah’s prediction in Jeremiah 51:11. He was probably very influenced by his trusting relationship to Daniel. Ahasuerus is also Darius the Mede who believes in the God of Daniel.

This Darius was made King by an appointment from Cyrus II. Daniel is one of three Governors assigned to rule over the Satraps and assist in governing the King’s realm. The connection of these two Kings, who are one and the same person, is critical to an accurate dating of the Kings of Israel and Persia. For many years, teachers of Bible chronology have insisted that there is a gap in the Assyrian data of 35-60 years.

555,Estimated Date of Prophet Habakkuk,EDFC,EDFC,,"Based on the text of the Book of Habakkuk, there is no information that would identify an accurate dating. Based on its placement in the Old Testament, this Prophet seems to follow closely after Nahum. The introduction to Habakkuk in the “MacArthur Study Bible” is very helpful in getting an estimate on the date of this minor Prophet. The rise of the Chaldeans, also known as the Babylonians, mentioned in Habakkuk 1:6 is probably a reference to the rise in power of Babylon during the time of Nabopolassar. Jeremiah has been a Prophet for thirteen years and Daniel is almost four years old. King Josiah is in the twenty-seventh year of his reign and Ezekiel is eight years old. In two years, Nebuchadnezzar will marry the daughter of Astayges and the following year Nineveh will fall to the Babylonian army. In ten years, Nebuchadnezzar will be made the King of Babylon, after deporting Daniel and others the previous year. These are extremely dark times for Israel as violence and wickedness are prevalent. Habakkuk pleads for divine intervention in Habakkuk 1:2-4. God answers that he will bring judgment to Israel by means of the Chaldeans (1:5-11).

564,Hilkiah Finds the Book of the Law,DFC,DFC,,"Hilkiah, the Priest, finds the Book of the Law and gives it to the King's Scribe Shaphan. This was possibly a rare find since many of the copies of the Book of the Law had been destroyed by King Manasseh and King Amon.",
564,Book of the Law Read to Hezekiah,DFC,DFC,,Shaphan reads the Book of the Law to the King. The King responds by ordering that a Prophet give him a word from the Lord concerning the Book of Law found in the Temple. Josiah is concerned about God’s wrath and Israel’s disobedience to His Word.,

565,Zephaniah Speaks as a Prophet,EDFC,EDFC,,"Zephaniah begins to speak as a Prophet in the seventeenth year of King Josiah. Zephaniah is the great-grandson of King Hezekiah and would have had royal access as a consultant and Prophet to Josiah. Four year earlier, Jeremiah had begun to speak publically as a Prophet. Josiah became king when he was eight years old and essentially continued the ungodly practices of his father and grandfather. Zephaniah calls the nation to repentance and warns of impending judgment. The following year, Hilkiah finds the Book of the Law and reads it to King Josiah. Josiah responds by initiating reforms in Temple Worship. Josiah’s repentance and complete return to the true worship of God was well received by God and many in the nation of Israel.",
569,Jeremiah Begins as Prophet in 13th Year of Josiah,DFC,DFC,,"This DFC date for the start of Jeremiah as a Prophet, in the thirteenth year of King Josiah, is extremely important in dating the reigns of the Southern Kings of Israel and the events of the Babylonian Exile. This DFC date becomes an anchor date for calculating many of the dated events found in the Books of Ezekiel, Daniel, and Jeremiah. This event happens thirteen accession years and sixty-three days into the calculated start date of the reign of Southern King Josiah.",
575,Birth of King Jehoiakim (South),DFC,DFC,,Jehoiakim would become king of the Southern Kingdom in twenty-five years and reign for eleven years.

589,Nahum Predicts Fall of Nineveh,EDFC,EDFC,,"Dating the Book of Nahum is very difficult. It appears that Nahum followed a few years after the Prophet Isaiah. It is estimated that Nahum gives his prophecy, regarding the fall of Nineveh, near the end of the reign of King Manasseh of Southern Israel. The entire Book of Nahum is dedicated to the prediction of the fall of Assyria and its capital at Nineveh. According to this Bible Timeline research, Nineveh falls in 552 BC. Nahum is possibly from the Northern part of Israel. It is also possible that the name of the city of Capernaum, near the town of Nazareth, is connected to this Prophet.

609,Manasseh Taken With Hooks to Babylon,EST,EST,,"The Assyrians were well known for their ability to torture. Hooks were often placed in a prisoner's nose. King Manasseh is clearly tortured when the text says, ""he was in affliction"". God’s retribution for King Manasseh’s idolatry was quick and set an example.",
609,King Manasseh Repents and God Responds,EST,EST,,Manasseh repents for his ungodly leadership in Israel. God hears his prayer and preparations are made to return King Manasseh to Jerusalem. The King who had previously set an example of a Baal worshiper now set the example of a repentant sinner.,

He now ""knew that the Lord was God"". The King also repaired the altar of the Lord and commanded the people to only worship the God of Israel. CD#337 is the DFC and EDFC date for events happening between 611 BC and 607 BC.",
610,God Promises to Judge Israel With Assyria,EDFC,EDFC,,"As a result of King Manasseh’s restoration of Baal worship, God promises to send military judgment on Israel. 2 Kings 21:10 states: “the Lord spoke by His servants the Prophets” to King Manasseh. It is very possible that one of these Prophets is Nahum. It appears that within a few years of this event, the Prophet Nahum gives his prophecy about the fall of Nineveh as punishment for this and other attacks on Israel. CD#337 is the DFC and EDFC date for events happening between 611 BC and 607 BC.",
614,Manasseh Restores Baal Worship,EDFC,EDFC,,King Manasseh rebuilds the altars for Baal that had been destroyed by his father Hezekiah. He also restored wooden images in a similar way that King Ahab had done in Northern Israel. During his reign he shed much innocent blood.

656,King Hezekiah's Death Predicted by Isaiah,EST,EST,,"King Hezekiah is told by Isaiah: “Thus says the Lord: ‘Set your house in order, for you shall die, and not live.’ ” After receiving this news from the Prophet Isaiah, King Hezekiah prayed to the Lord and wept bitterly.",
656,Isaiah Returns With Good News for King Hezekiah,EST,EST,,Isaiah leaves the presence of the King and is walking away through the middle court. The Lord stops Isaiah and tells him to return to King Hezekiah and tell him he will be healed. King Hezekiah is instructed to go to the house of the Lord in three days. A lump of figs is placed on the boil and Hezekiah is healed. Hezekiah is told he will live for another fifteen years. The sundial goes back in time as a sign that Isaiah’s prophecy of Hezekiah’s healing is true.,
656,The Sundial is Turned Back in Time,EST,EST,,"Many translations read that “the sun returned ten degrees”. This is more likely “ten steps”. Some commentators speculate that a stairway had been built by King Ahaz to function as a sundial measurement devise. People could tell the time of day according to what step the shadow of the sundial was on. This author estimates that by moving ten steps backwards, time was reversed three hours. Since three hours would be repeated as the sundial resumed its normal pace, this particular day would be thirty hours in length. This was a very clear sign from the Lord that Hezekiah would not die from his illness and would live another 15 years. It is interesting to note that King Ahaz, father of King Hezekiah, had refused a sign from the Lord, according to Isaiah 7:10-12. If this author’s assessment is correct about the working of the sundial, this event also has a practical application to the solar calendar. From this point forward, a solar calendar day would be counted as starting at midnight instead of 6:00 p.m. of the previous day as it does on a Hebrew calendar. This theory is presented only as an interesting speculation.",
656,Babylonian Envoy Visits Hezekiah,EST,EST,,"Merodach-Baladan, the son of Baladan, King of Babylon, sent an envoy to visit King Hezekiah after he had recovered from his illness. Hezekiah foolishly showed them all the treasures, spices and precious ointment of the Temple and his dominion. King Hezekiah was trying to impress them with his riches in the hope that Babylon would be an ally against a future Assyrian threat. On this same date, 130 years later, Babylon would start burning the Temple in Jerusalem and take the Temple treasures and many of the people into exile.",
656,Isaiah Predicts Peace Now-Babylon Will Defeat Israel Later,EST,EST,,"When Isaiah hears about the Babylonian visitors, he shows up unannounced to confront King Hezekiah. Isaiah lets Hezekiah know that he will have peace now and for the rest of his reign. Isaiah tells King Hezekiah that his descendants will be carried off to Babylon as well as all the treasures he has shown to the visitors from Babylon.",
656,God's People are Comforted by Isaiah,EDFC,EDFC,,"In this section of the Book of Isaiah, the situation in Judah, 130 years later, is described when the Babylonians have defeated Israel and taken many into Exile. Isaiah gives comfort and assurance that some will return from captivity and God will not forsake Israel. More detailed information can be found in the footnotes of the MacArthur Study Bible and other commentaries.",
657,Assyria Attacks in Fourteenth Year of Hezekiah,EST,EST,,"King Sennacherib of Assyria attacked the fortified cities in Judah and around Jerusalem. King Hezekiah attempts to bribe King Sennacherib into not attacking Jerusalem by promising: “whatever you impose on me I will pay”. Hezekiah was assessed three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. King Hezekiah gave King Sennacherib “all the silver from the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the King’s house”. King Hezekiah also stripped the gold from the doors of the Temple and gave it the King of Assyria. It is possible that King Sennacherib is not the King of Assyria mentioned in this part of Scripture. King Sennacherib appears to have ruled earlier. At this point in time in Scripture, there is a discrepancy of forty to sixty years in the text compared to current Bible chronology. The name of a foreign King in the Biblical text may be a translation problem due to the fact that foreign kings often go by different names. More research needs to be done to clarify this issue. The fact of a conflict with Assyria and Israel at this point in history is not questioned. Only the correct name of the foreign King is an issue that needs more research. It is estimated that this attack happens thirteen accession years and 151 days into the reign of Southern King Hezekiah.",
657,King Sennacherib of Assyria Boasts Against the Lord,EST,EST,,"After receiving the tribute of gold and silver from King Hezekiah, King Sennacherib sends messengers advising the people of Judah to disregard the advice of King Hezekiah who was relying on the protection of the Lord for deliverance. King Sennacherib’s messengers publically mock the God of Israel and threaten destruction to Jerusalem.",
657,Isaiah Assures the Deliverance of Israel From Assyria,EST,EST,,"When King Hezekiah heard the demands of the Assyrian Army, he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth. This was a symbolic act of grief and repentance. Hezekiah was well aware that the nation needed to show repentance to the Lord. King Hezekiah led the way in demonstrating an attitude of repentance and asking for the Lord to intervene on Israel’s behalf. Isaiah appears at the request of the King to “pray for the remnant that is left”. At this point it had been forty-seven years since the death of King Uzziah and the vision of Isaiah described in Isaiah 6:1. Isaiah tells King Hezekiah to not be afraid. He had given this same assurance to King Ahaz in Isaiah 7:4. Isaiah states that the Assyrian Army will return to their land and not destroy Jerusalem. Isaiah also claims that the King of Assyria will fall by the sword in his own land.",
657,Sennacherib's Threat and Hezekiah's Prayer,EST,EST,,"In this section of Scripture, Assyria attacks King Tirhakah of Ethiopia after defeating the city of Lachish. This research estimates the dates of the reign of King Tirhakah from 674 BC to 648 BC. Assyria withdraws from the battle with Ethiopia and returns to Jerusalem. The Assyrian message to Israel is that they cannot trust in the words of King Hezekiah or the Word of the Lord. King Hezekiah asks God to show his power in saving Israel from defeat despite Israel’s unworthiness to receive such favor from the Lord.",
657,Isaiah Delivers God's Answer to Hezekiah's Prayer,EST,EST,,"Isaiah proclaims that God will deliver Israel from a defeat by Assyria. God clearly shows that He is the one true God and cannot be compared to the false gods of the nations conquered by Assyria. Isaiah’s message states that Assyria will not even enter the city of Jerusalem for a battle. The Lord says in Isaiah 37:35, “I will defend this city, to save it For My own sake and for My servant David’s sake”. The commentary in the ""MacArthur Study Bible (p. 1010)"", for Isaiah 37:32, makes a profound statement connecting these events to God’s promise in Isaiah 9:7. The ""Study Bible"" states: “The same confirmation of God’s promise in 9:7 assured the future establishment of the messianic kingdom. Deliverance from Sennacherib in Hezekiah’s day was a down payment on the literal, final restoration of Israel"".",
657,Assyria Defeated While Asleep,EST,EST,,"One night while the Assyrian army was sleeping, “the angel of the Lord went out, and killed in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand”. This happened before an attack on Jerusalem had been made by the Assyrian Army. The few soldiers who were left and the Assyrian King returned home in defeat. The text has been translated to claim that this king was Sennacherib. This research suggests that the Assyrian king was probably a grandson of Sennacherib. More research will be done to clarify this apparent discrepancy.",
657,Assyrian King is Murdered by his Sons,DFC,DFC,,"After returning home in disgrace, the Assyrian King is murdered by his two sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer while worshiping in the temple of Nisroch his god. According to http//topicalbible.org/s/sharezer.htm, “The Babylonian Chronicle says concerning Sennacherib’s death: “On the 20th day of Tebet Sennacherib, king of Assyria, was slain by his son in a revolt”. This differs from the Old Testament account in that it speaks of only one murderer, and does not give his name. How the two accounts can be harmonized is still uncertain. Further research will likely show some of the currently named foreign kings are identified by the wrong name since the current Bible chronology dates for this period are not in harmony with Scripture by as much as 60 years. The King mentioned here is probably the son of Esarhaddon and possibly known in history as Sardanapalus who was apparently related to Ashurbanipal. CD#327 is the DFC and EDFC date for events happening between 661 BC and 657 BC.",
665,Hosea Predicts Fall of Northern Israel at Dawn,MDFC-1,MDFC-1,,,
665,End of Reign of Hoshea and Northern Kingdom,DFC,DFC,,"This end of the Northern Kingdom of Israel is usually stated as happening around 721 BC. The 721 BC date is inconsistent with the numbers in Scripture by about 60 years. It is assumed by many Bible Chronologists that there are about thirty-five to sixty years missing in the Assyrian dates. This research shows that the dates for the start of the Babylonian Exile in 526 BC, instead of 586 BC, and the end of the Northern Kingdom in 665 BC, instead of 721 BC, are significant mathematical errors deeply imbedded in current Bible chronology. This research concludes that many of the Assyrian dates are likely accurate and completely consistent with the numbers found in the Masoretic text of Scripture. The reign of Northern King Hoshea lasts nine accession years and 184 days. The DFC date for the end of the Northern Kingdom is six accession years and one day into the reign of Southern King Hezekiah. CD#326 is the DFC and EDFC date for events happening between 666 BC and 662 BC. This DFC date is extremely important in dating the reigns and events of Israel’s Kings.

667,Assyria Attacks in 7th Year of Hoshea and 4th of Hezekiah,MDFC-182,MDFC-182,,Assyria attacks Northern Israel seven accession years and one day into the reign of Northern King Hoshea. This same attack happens 182 days into the 4th non-accession year of the reign of Southern King Hezekiah. The attack lasts two accession years and 183 days. The battle ends in the sixth year of the reign of Southern King Hezekiah. The accurate dating of this event is necessary to develop a Bible chronology that is consistent with the dated events of the Masoretic Biblical text.,
668,Visions of Micah the Prophet,DFC,DFC,,"The Book of Micah gives important clues in the first verse to identify the time period of this Prophet. Micah’s life is during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah in Judah. Micah predicts judgment on Samaria (Northern Kingdom) and Jerusalem in Chapter 1. Micah follows Isaiah and precedes Nahum. Micah is clearly a contemporary of Hosea. It is estimated that Micah is born around 700 BC, during the reign of Jotham. It is also estimated that Micah begins to be a Prophet in 670 BC. This is one year after the end of the reign of Ahaz and early in the reign of King Hezekiah. The visions of Micah seem to start in the third year of the reign of Hezekiah. The vision of the Messiah being born in Bethlehem Ephrathah, the most famous of his prophecies, is found in Micah 5:2. These visions happen about six months before Assyria attacks in the fourth year of Hezekiah’s reign. The Northern Kingdom would fall in 665 BC in the sixth year of Hezekiah’s reign.",

705,Estimated Start of Hosea as Prophet,EDFC,EDFC,,"Hosea follows Amos as a Prophet and is a contemporary of Isaiah and Micah. Hosea 1:1 lists the same Kings of Israel as Isaiah 1:1, identifying his time as a Prophet. It is estimated that he begins as a Prophet in the Northern Kingdom just before the death of King Uzziah in the South. King Pekah has just started his reign in Northern Israel.

730,Co-Reign of King Zechariah (North) Begins?,EST,EST,,"There is a question mark regarding this reign. It is unclear if this is a co-reign with Zechariah or if there is a lot of confusion about who is in charge of Northern Israel. It is clear that King Zechariah has a six month reign after this period of time but it is not clear what happens from 730 BC to 718 BC. There may have been no King in Northern Israel at this time. 721 BC is often given as the year for the fall of the North, but this date is mathematically inconsistent with Scripture by about sixty years. Northern Israel is defeated in 665 BC, according to the mathematics of the Biblical text if 1445 BC is the year of the Exodus. Ezra 4:2 is clear that many in Northern Israel and Samaria were brought there by King Esarhaddon of Assyria who ruled from 681 BC to 669 BC. It is also clear that Esarhaddon died about four years before the Fall of Northern Israel.

This devastating attack by locusts was a prophecy found in Amos 7:1-3. This prophecy by Amos probably happened around 759 BC. The locusts attack in 758 BC just before the end of the reign of Amaziah (South) and the start of reign of Uzziah in 757 BC.

Amos 1:1 states these events are in the days of King Uzziah of Judah (757 BC-704 BC) and Jeroboam II (772 BC-730 BC), son of Joash, in Northern Israel. The prophecy starts two years before a great earthquake. In the footnotes for this verse, in the “MacArthur Study Bible-p.1277”, the earthquake is dated around 760 BC. This puts the start of the Book of Amos in 762 BC. Amos is likely a contemporary of the Prophets Joel and Jonah.",
764,Jonah: The Reluctant Prophet,EDFC,EDFC,,"The story of Jonah is one of the most popular Old Testament tales told to children in Sunday school classes all over the world. Scripture clearly treats this as real history and not an allegory as many claim. The universal message is very clear that the God of the Bible is the God of all people, Jew or Gentile. The message is also clear that anyone willing to repent and turn to God can be saved. The story of Jonah contains theological messages for individuals and nations. Jonah is the only minor Prophet mentioned by name by Jesus. The author of this Timeline research dates this event near the year 764 BC. The year before there had been a severe plague which may have helped prepare the hearts of the people of Nineveh to repentance. This date would be in the eighth year of Jeroboam II (North) and the twenty-second year of Amaziah (South). The connection to the reign of Jeroboam II is found in 2 Kings 14:24. There is much agreement that the Assyrian King was Ashurdan III who ruled from 771 BC until 754 BC. Jonah was a contemporary of the Prophets Amos and Joel. Jonah is often identified by Jewish historians as being the son of the widow at Zarephath. The widow’s son was raised from the dead by Elijah in 1 Kings 17. Since the Zarephath incident was almost 100 years earlier, Jonah would more likely be a great-grandson of the widow if they were related.",

Southern King Ahaziah and Northern King Joram are both killed by Jehu making him the King in Northern Israel. The reign of Southern King Jehoram (Joram) lasted seven accession years and 14 days.

Jehu also killed Northern Israel's King, Joram. This double murder made Jehu the King of Northern Israel. When Athaliah learns that her son has been murdered by Jehu, she kills all the royal heirs of the Southern Kingdom, except Joash. She then declares herself the Queen of Israel. Joash, the infant son of King Ahaziah, is hidden along with the infant’s nurse in the house of the Lord for six years.

The fact that both years are mentioned seems to pinpoint the DFC date in the year 835 BC. King Ahaziah begins his reign eleven accession years and 356 days into the reign of King Joram (Jehoram) (North). CD#292 is the DFC and EDFC date for events happening between 836 BC and 832 BC.

836,Edomites Assault Jerusalem,EDFC,EDFC,,"The Book of Obadiah focuses on the Edomite assault on Jerusalem found in verses 10-14. Edomites were descendants of Esau, the brother of Jacob. Obadiah verbally attacks the Edomites “for violence against your brother Jacob (verse 10)”. The MacArthur Study Bible’s introduction to the Book of Obadiah accurately connects this attack to the battle with the Edomites, Philistines and Arabians, described in 2 Chronicles 21:8-20. In 2 Chronicles 21:12-15, Elisha sends a letter to King Jehoram (South). In this letter, Elisha warns the King that he will suffer a terrible disease of the intestines that will cause his death. Elisha states that King Jehoram will be punished for his idolatry and the “harlotry of the house of Ahab (21:13)”. This attack on Jerusalem happens in 836 BC. Two years later, Jehu would kill the Kings of the Northern and Southern Kingdoms. This Obadiah is probably the same Obadiah that meets with Elijah and King Ahab 19 years earlier, as recorded in 1 Kings 18:2-18. Many commentaries claim the Obadiah that authored the book with his name is a different Obadiah than the person that meets with Elijah.",

1000,The Ark is Brought to Jerusalem,EST,EST,,"The return of the Ark may be marked as the end of 450 years of the Judges beginning with Amenhotep II, the new oppressive Pharaoh in Egypt in 1450 BC. This is the Pharaoh who would meet with Moses five years later in 1445 BC when Moses is eighty years old. This “about” 450 year period is mentioned in Acts 13:20-22. If this period of time is moved fifteen years earlier at the start, around 1465 BC, then the 450 years would end about the time of the death of Samuel estimated to be around 1015 BC. The 450 year period may also be measured as starting in 1485 BC when Moses flees Egypt at the age of forty after killing an Egyptian. This event happens during the reign of the Egyptian Pharaoh, Thutmose III. Thutmose III is the non-related step-brother of Moses who is raised as an Egyptian Prince by Queen Hatshepsut. Queen Hatshepsut may be the Pharaoh’s daughter who found Moses in the ark of bulrushes in the reeds of the Nile River, described in Exodus 2:1-10. Thutmose III is the Pharaoh of the Oppression, according to the New King James Version of the “MacArthur Study Bible (Page 3)” and many other sources. Four-hundred and fifty years after this date, in 1035 BC, King Saul would be in the fifteenth year of his reign, Samuel would be the King’s Prophet, and David would be five years old.",

David is made King at the age of thirty. David is born twenty-eight generations of 40-years each from the sixth year of Abraham.

1405,Sun Stands Still Allowing Defeat of Amorites,EST,EST,,"There has been much speculation in Biblical commentaries to explain this text. Scripture is clear that the sun stood still and the moon stopped. Many claim some form of a solar eclipse that kept the sun's heat from Israel’s soldiers until they prevailed against the Amorites. Other commentaries claim that the sun appeared to stop. Joshua 10:13 is very clear: “So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day”. American Indians, who would have been on the other side of the earth, talk about the “long night” that occurred at this same time in history. This research concludes that what is probably being described here is a 48-hour day with one sunrise and one sunset. The obvious purpose of this miracle is to show God’s power in giving Israel a victory over the Amorites. It is also an answer to Joshua’s public prayer request before all of Israel. In relation to the effect on earth’s calendars, this is one of eight days needed to line up the 364-Day calendar, consistent with the Old Testament from Creation to the birth of Jesus, with the Gregorian calendar used today. The conclusion of this research is that this event happens on a Friday that is extended to cover a 48-hour period. On the Gregorian calendar, this would digitally show up as two days on the computer generated Gregorian calendar.",

The DFC date of Jacob’s arrival in Egypt, at the age of 130, is Wednesday, January 9 - Tevet 20 in 1875 BC. This Nisan 17 date, like the day Noah takes the Covering off the Ark, is an Anchor date for the entire Bible Timeline. The start of the Exodus functions as the center point of Biblical history. Using only the 364-Day calendar and the dates in the text of Scripture, almost every event in the Bible can be accurately calculated or estimated within a small margin of error. The DFC dates function like markings on a ruler with estimated dates falling in between. The Calendar Day Number (CD#170) is one-fifth of the number of completed years since Creation Week. At this point in the Bible timeline, one-fifth of the completed years since Creation Week would be 534. Since there are only 364 Calendar Day Numbers, 364 must be subtracted resulting in CD#170 as the DFC date for this year. CD#170 is the DFC date for events happening between 1446 BC and 1442 BC.",

God repeatedly teaches the nation of Israel that He is their God and the provider of everything they will need.",
1445,Quails Came Up and Covered the Camp,DIS,DIS,,"God keeps His promise and sends meat in the form of quail. Ancient Egyptian paintings show people throwing nets over quail in bushes who are exhausted after a long migration flight.

1897,Joseph at 17 is Taken to Egypt,DFC,DFC,,"On Friday, January 4 - Tevet 15, 1897 BC, Joseph is with his father Jacob at their home in Hebron in the land of Canaan. Jacob and his family had moved from Bethel to Hebron two and a half years earlier after the death of Jacob’s wife, Rachel. Rachel died giving birth to Jacob’s youngest son, Benjamin just outside of Bethlehem. This event is described in Genesis 35:16-19. Benjamin was the only younger brother of Joseph who was also born to Rachel. Joseph had recently told his father and brothers about a dream in which his older brothers and “the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to me”, as recorded in Genesis 37:5-10. Joseph had previously brought back a negative report about his brothers to his father Jacob. Jacob had seemingly rewarded him with a tunic of many colors and showed obvious favoritism to Joseph (Genesis 37:3). Jacob seemed to ignore the obvious hostility and resentment toward Joseph by his older brothers. Verse 12 tells us that Jacob had sent the other brothers off to Shechem, about 40 miles away, to feed one of their flocks of sheep. Jacob decides to send Joseph to check on his brothers and bring him back a report. This was a decision that Jacob would regret but was obviously part of God’s plan to move Jacob and his family to Egypt twenty-two years later. Two days later, Joseph arrived in Shechem but his brothers are not where he expected to find them. Verses 15-17 tell of a man who found Joseph wandering in a field at Shechem. Many think this man may have been an angel or messenger sent from God to direct Joseph to his brothers who had moved the flocks to Dothan, about 10 miles away. \pThe move to Dothan was very important since this put Joseph’s brothers in view of the trading routes between Gilead and Egypt. On Friday, January 4 at the age of 17, Joseph found his brothers feeding the flocks at Dothan. As soon as his brothers saw him coming they began to plan his demise. When Joseph’s oldest brother Reuben heard his brothers plan to kill Joseph, he suggested they just put Joseph in an empty pit or well. Verse 21 tells how Reuben’s plan was to put Joseph in a pit and then come back later to rescue him and take him to his father. The brothers grabbed Joseph and removed his beautiful multicolored tunic given to him as a special gift from their father, Jacob. They threw him into an empty pit with no water. This was probably a dry well. Verse 25 tells how the brothers sat down to eat a meal after Joseph was in the pit and Reuben was apparently not present at that moment. The brothers saw a caravan of Midianite traders passing by and at Judah’s suggestion sold Joseph into slavery. Midianites are also called Ishmaelites in verse 25 since they are descendants of Ishmael through his wife, Keturah described in Genesis 25:1-2. Joseph was sold into slavery for twenty shekels of silver. This was a common practice at this time in history among some non-Hebrew people. \pUnder Mosaic law at the time of the Exodus, 452 years later, kidnapping and selling an Israelite was punishable by the death penalty, according to Exodus 21:16 and Deuteronomy 24:7. By 30 AD, the cost of a slave had only risen to 30 pieces of silver. This is the amount that Judas, the disciple of Jesus, got for betraying Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. Joseph was taken to Egypt and sold to Potiphar, “an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard”, as recorded in Verse 36. When Reuben came back to rescue Joseph from the pit, he was very grieved to find out that Joseph had been sold into slavery. He probably joined in the cover up since he would have been held responsible by his father since he was the oldest. The brothers killed a “kid of the goats” (Verse 31) and dipped the colorful tunic of Joseph into the young goat’s blood. They brought this to their father who identified the tunic as belonging to Joseph. Jacob assumed, from the evidence presented that his son, Joseph was dead. It is interesting to note that Jacob was deceived by his sons, in a similar way that he deceived his father, Isaac to steal the inheritance from Esau, as described in Genesis 27:18-19. Both stories involve the use of a freshly killed young goat in the deception. This might explain why Jacob does not seem very upset with his sons when he later finds out that Joseph is alive and he had been previously deceived by his sons. It would be 22 years later that Jacob would see Joseph in Egypt. At this point in history, Jacob is 108 years old. CD#79 is the DFC date for events happening between 1901 BC and 1897 BC.",

Abraham would remain in Hebron until his death, thirty-eight years later, at the age of 175. This dating of this event clarifies Acts 7:2-4 and Hebrews 11:8-10.

2166,Birth of Abraham-Son of Terah,DFC,DFC,,"The birth of Abraham begins a period of 290 DFC years plus 58 days until Jacob’s arrival in Egypt at the age of 130 to join Joseph. Abraham is born when his father, Terah, is 70 years old. Abraham is the father of Isaac. Many commentaries erroneously claim that Terah is 130 when Abraham is born. This 60 year error has gone often unchallenged since it was introduced by James Ussher in his 17th century dating of the events in Biblical and world history. Ussher’s error triggered a series of mathematical miscalculations in the start of the Babylonian Exile in 588 BC and the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple in 515 BC. Even though most of Ussher’s dates prior to 454 BC have proven incorrect, these three main errors remain firmly entrenched in modern Bible chronology. Ussher’s calculation of the number of years from Creation until the birth of Jesus was 3,999. Instead, the correct number of solar years is 4,096 which are clearly stated in the Biblical text (See Exact Years Chart in Chapter 29). This error was the main stumbling block of subsequent attempts at calculating an accurate Bible chronology. The correction of this mathematical error was extremely difficult prior to the invention of the computer and an Excel spreadsheet. This Monday, November 11–Heshvan 22 date is also the birth date of Seth (3985 BC), the son of Adam, and King David (1040 BC). CD#26 is the DFC date for events between 2166 BC and 2162 BC.",

This is the only example of a skipped generation in the dating of the birth of a patriarch in the Old Testament.

A raven could survive on almost anything it could find to eat and would not be as selective as a dove. The raven does not return to the Ark. It could fly back and forth to the Ark but seems to have found enough food to eat as it is a scavenger.,
2457,Noah Releases First Dove,DIS,DIS,,Noah sends out a raven and a dove on the same day. The dove returns because there is probably no place to land that feels as safe as the Ark. The dove is apparently more selective in what it can eat than a raven. The raven does not return to Noah.,

When the dove does not return it is a sign that birds can now survive independently of the Ark as a home base. There was now a supply of food for birds and other animals.

Fiery balls of matter will fall like rain on the earth and possibly other parts of our solar system. Isaiah 34:4 expresses the end of time in this way: ""All the host of heaven shall be dissolved, And the mountains shall be melted with their blood. All the heavens shall be rolled up like a scroll; All the host shall fall down As the leaf falls from the vine, And as fruit falling from a fig tree"".

If the DFC is an exact date of an event, this DFC date seems to solve a long standing question as to whether or not Methuselah was killed by the Flood since he dies in the same year as the Flood. The question remains open as to whether or not the DFC date is the exact date of an event or does the DFC date function like the marks on a ruler giving an approximate date when the exact date is not stated.

3985,Birth of Seth-Son of Adam,DFC,DFC,,"Seth is the firstborn in the “sacred line” or “blessed” heirs of Adam and Eve. The lineage of Jesus can be traced back though Seth to Adam. The sacred line of Jesus, through Joseph, the husband of Mary, is found in Matthew 1:1-17. This unique section of Scripture uses 14 consecutive 40-year spans for connecting generations, rather than the actual birth order of father and son. The sacred line of Jesus, through his mother, Mary, can be found in Luke 3:23-38. In contrast, the “secular line” refers to the descendants of Cain. Many of Cain’s descendants are named in order of birth, without giving the age of the father at the time of the heir’s birth. There is no way to precisely track secular line descendants in a Timeline. Those who follow in the secular line are generally historic enemies of their brothers in the “sacred line”. Jacob and Esau, Isaac and Ishmael, would be good examples of family lines that are frequent enemies in history. \pThe birth of Seth is the first DFC date that can be accurately measured from the number of years from Creation given in the Biblical text.

4085,Cain and Abel Make an Offering to the Lord,EDFC,EDFC,,"Cain and Abel present an offering to the Lord. Cain is estimated to be 30 years old when this event happens. Both Cain and Abel had apparently received instructions on making a sacrificial offering to God. These instructions are not recorded in the text of Scripture. It does appear that one way God measures loyalty and obedience in a person’s heart is by the attitude of giving to Him. Cain was a tiller of the ground and Abel took care of sheep. Like many farmers today, Cain and Abel probably raised both crops and animals but tended to specialize in one or the other so they would be able to offer either type of sacrifice. Both occupations appear to be respectable to God. It is the condition of the servant’s heart that is of concern to God. Like all DFC and EDFC dates from this point on in the Bible Timeline, the Calendar Day Number (CD#6) is one-fifth of the number of years since Creation Day 3 of Creation Week. CD#6 is the DFC date for events happening between 4086 BC and 4082 BC.",
4085,The Lord Does Not Respect Cain's Offering,EST,EST,,"Hebrews 11:4 records that Abel’s offering was an act of faith in giving God the best of what he had produced in the form of the firstborn of his flock. Both brothers knew what God expected from them. Abel was obedient to God and Cain was not. When Cain realized his offering was not acceptable to God he became very angry. Instead of repenting of his sin, Cain was disappointed and angry with God. God warns Cain that if he remains disobedient, Sin will crouch at the door like a lion waiting to jump on its prey. Cain does not heed God’s warning and sin takes its tragic course.",
4085,Cain Murders Abel,EST,EST,,"Since Cain cannot direct his anger toward God and refuses to be obedient to God’s commands, he decides to take his anger out on his brother Abel and kills him. This is the first murder in history. Cain’s motive of jealousy over his brother’s righteousness is mentioned in 1 John 3:12 and Jude 11. For more commentary, see the MacArthur Study Bible for extensive notes and references regarding this event.",

4085,The Family of Cain Moves to Nod,EST,EST,,"Cain and his family are banished from the area where his family members still reside. He moves to Nod which is described as “east of Eden”. Here he would build a city named after his son, Enoch, and would beget many children. This city called Enoch would thrive until the events of Noah’s Flood when the world population may have been comparable to what it is today. The dating of these events related to Cain and Abel is very difficult since no number of years is given. These events could have been up to a hundred years later but are likely to have occurred before the DFC date of the birth of Seth, 130 years after Creation Week.",
4113,Birth of Abel-Son of Adam and Eve,EDFC,EDFC,,Abel appears to be the second son of Adam and Eve. This event is also an EDFC event since the number of years is not stated. This event is estimated to be one year after the birth of his older brother Cain.,
4114,Birth of Cain-Son of Adam and Eve,EDFC,EDFC,,"Cain appears to be the firstborn of the “secular line” of Adam and Eve. Seth would be the firstborn of the “sacred line” through Adam and Eve. The “secular line” refers to the descendants of Cain. Many of Cain’s descendants are named in order of birth, without giving the age of the father at the time of the heir’s birth. There is no way to precisely track the secular line descendants in a Timeline that is connected back to Creation Week or any other dated event in Scripture. Those who follow in the secular line are generally historic enemies of their brothers in the “sacred line”. Jacob and Esau, Isaac and Ishmael, would be good examples of family lines that are frequent enemies in history. In contract, the sacred line can be traced from Creation through King David to the birth of Jesus. The sacred line of Jesus, through Joseph, the husband of Mary, is found in Matthew 1:1-17. This unique section of Scripture uses 14 consecutive 40-year spans for connecting generations, rather than the actual birth order of father and son. The sacred line of Jesus, through his mother, Mary can be found in Luke 3:23-38. This is the first EDFC (estimated date from Creation) since the number of years from Creation until this event is not stated. This is the DFC date for one year from Creation Day 3 in 4115 BC. See Chapter titled, “Type of Dated Event in Scripture Explained”, for an explanation of DFC, EDFC, and other types of days identified as dated events in Scripture.",
4115,"Creation Week Begins-""the beginning""","""the beginning""","""the beginning""",,"Sunday, 6:00 p.m. on a solar calendar, is “the beginning” of Creation Week and the start of Monday, Creation Day 1 on the 364-Day Hebrew calendar consistent with the Biblical text. This 364-Day Bible Reference (BR) calendar digitally generates the main solar calendars used today. This opening verse of Scripture states that God begins the act of Creation by creating the space needed for the universe and matter in the form of the earth. When it is 6:00 p.m. in what is now known as Israel, it is 3:00 a.m. on the International Date Line of the same day. It is important to understand that a 24-hour Hebrew calendar day starts at 6:00 p.m. of the day prior to a normal solar calendar day that starts at midnight. On the Gregorian solar calendar, generated by the 364-Day calendar, the start time of Creation Week is 6:00 p.m. on Sunday, October 21 in 4101 BC. It is from this moment in time that the events of Scripture can be measured on the solar calendars and clocks currently in use today. The Julian day number, given on this date on the solar calendar, is at the end of Sunday at 6:00 p.m. This moment in time starts the beginning of Monday, Creation Day 1 on the Hebrew calendar consistent with the dated events of Scripture. All future Julian day numbers represent the day number at the start of the Hebrew day at 6:00 p.m. This is the moment time begins. From this point on, a segment of eternity can be measured on a calendar in days, weeks, months and years.",
4115,Creation Day 1,Day#1 Creation,Day#1 Creation,,"Time intersects and anchors into eternity as time begins the events of Creation Day 1. On this “first day”, the heavens, earth, time, light and energy are created. Time begins as God starts the act of Creation by creating a great deal of space. Into this large amount of space, God creates a large amount of formless and seemingly non-energized matter called earth. This monument event of Creation Week that is both incomprehensible and unexplainable is described with very few words in Genesis 1:1-2: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters”. This seemingly effortless action taken by God is followed by his first recorded command in Genesis 1:3: “Let there be light”; and there was light.” \pMany commentaries on this verse emphasize the theory that God simply turns on the light in a vast expanse of darkness during this part of the Creation process. We can easily miss the significance of this event if we assume that God was working in the dark prior to this moment. This verse is Genesis is describing a much more significant act of Creation that is easily missed by the economy of words in the text. The light that we see is only one of more than 75 octaves of known forms of light. The entire electromagnetic spectrum of light is infused as energy into all matter and seemingly empty space. Science claims that even in empty space, that contains no molecules of matter, there is a tremendous amount of energy. This “light” is the glue that gives shape and motion to the chemical elements that make up space and matter. At the moment “light” is created in history, all matter and space is energized and begins to move. \pHistory begins and everything exists in measurable time. In Genesis 1:3, God starts and continually sustains the constantly moving and energized universe. Time and history begin with the simple declaration of His Word, “Let there be light”; and there was light”. The Julian day number given on this date is at the end of Monday at 6:00 p.m. which starts the beginning of Tuesday, Creation Day 2. All future Julian day numbers, ending digitally with .75, represent the day number at the start of the Hebrew calendar day at 6:00 p.m. This Bible Timeline research will clearly show that the 364-Day calendar, consistent with Scripture, digitally starts on this day and generates the solar calendars used on earth today.",
4115,Creation Day 2,Day#2 Creation,Day#2 Creation,,"Space and matter are separated on Creation Day 2. Day 2 of Creation Week is another day of separation and order. On this day, the earth that is covered in water is separated by a space called the “firmament” which God calls “Heaven” in Genesis 1:8. This “firmament” is the sky and space above that we see when we look up from the earth. In this atmosphere wrapped around the earth, in this space called heaven, there is also a great amount of water in the form of thick clouds which some refer to as a canopy of water vapor around the earth. The exact nature of this water area above the area called firmament or heaven cannot be precisely known as it has apparently changed since the time of Noah’s Flood. In Scripture, the first heaven is what we would call our atmosphere and is what is created on Creation Day 2. The second heaven in Scripture is created on Creation Day 4 when God makes the sun, moon, stars, and everything we refer to as the universe beyond our atmosphere. The third heaven of Scripture is what we normally refer to as the place where God is seen and the dwelling place of the saints. This third heaven is referred to by Paul in 2 Corinthians 12:2.",
4115,Creation Day 3,Day#3 Creation,Day#3 Creation,,"The first plant life forms are made on Creation Day 3. On this third day of Creation, God makes His last main separation by dividing the water from the land. The day starts with an earth covered by water. The day ends with the water gathered in one place and the appearance of dry land. The description in Chapter 1 of Genesis seems to imply, that at the end of this third day of Creation, there is one piece of land that is surrounded by one body of water. This appears to be consistent with what is seen by looking at a globe of the earth. The current continents appear to have once been one piece that was broken up like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle at the time of Noah’s Flood. God simply speaks and the waters separate and the land appears. “God called the dry land earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called seas”. The earth that was once “without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep”, described in Genesis 1:2, now has the shapes formed by earth (land) and sea that can be seen due to the presence of light. The land and the water are now both divided shapes of matter that can be filled with all forms of life “according to its kind”. God spoke again and “the earth brought forth grass, the herb that yields seeds according to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind”, according to Genesis 1:12. All plant life was fully grown and able to reproduce itself. The fruit, seeds and plants would also produce food for the animal life that would be created on days five and six of Creation Week. We can reasonably assume that there was also plant life in the seas as well as the land. Even though the sun would not be created until the next day, the process of photosynthesis in plants that produces oxygen for water and land animals would have started due to the presence of the light that was created on Creation Day 1 of Creation Week.",
4115,Creation Day 4,Day#4 Creation,Day#4 Creation,,"Creation Day 4 becomes the completion and fulfillment of Creation Day 1. On Creation Day 1 the separation between darkness and light is created by the creation of light. On the fourth day, the light created on Creation Day 1 is attached to or reflected by the heavenly bodies such as stars, moons, planets, comets and our sun. Genesis 1:14 states, the ""lights in the firmament"" begin functioning as transmitters of light. On the fourth day of Creation, God attaches the light He has made on the first day of Creation to the different ""heavenly bodies"". This totally removes the argument for an old earth because some stars are four million light years away. The argument claims that we are seeing the light that left such stars four million years ago. What we are seeing is the light that left such stars about 6,113 solar years ago, when the universe was created. God created the stars and the light between them and earth at the same time. The sun and stars appear to produce their own light as they burn matter. Planets and moons reflect light from stars. Science claims that the sun appears to be made up of 98% helium and hydrogen. Science is unable to explain the process by which the sun burns many thousands of tons of this matter every second. It has been known for many years that the sun is shrinking in diameter at a rate of about five feet in diameter per day. One scientist has estimated that if the sun were 50,000 years old, the oceans on earth would have boiled unless the sun was a much greater distance away. Several scientists have concluded that based on the speed of the shrinking sun, it seems impossible that the sun and earth could be older than about 7,000 years. This fact and other scientific findings, like the measured decline of earth’s magnetic field since 1830, show that the earth cannot be more than 10,000 years based on our knowledge of certain scientific realities of physics. The reader is encouraged to do their own research of the facts in order to properly discern scientific fact from fictional evolutionary theory that is not based on true scientific investigation.",
4115,Creation Day 5,Day#5 Creation,Day#5 Creation,,"On Creation Day 5, God speaks swarms of living creatures into the sea and fills the expanse above the earth with birds. Creation Day 5 is the first day of conscious life forms. On Creation Day 3, plants were made that were living things but without consciousness or the ability to independently move freely. According to Genesis 1:22, God commands all living creatures in the sea and air (heavens) to: “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters of the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth”. The same command is given to all the animals on land and to Adam and Eve on the sixth day of Creation Week. On the Gregorian-Hebrew Calendar (GH), the corresponding date for the fifth day of Creation Week is Friday October 26 – Heshvan 5, 4101 BC (GH). The ability to reproduce in obedience to God’s command is only possible because each species has its own DNA coding. On days three, five, and six, the phrase “according to its kind” is used a total of ten times in Genesis 1:11-25. On Day 3 it is very clear that grass, herbs and fruit trees produce other plants with the same genetic coding. Grasses do not become fruit trees. There is no evolutionary process of one species becoming another. \pThere is no mention in Scripture of simple life forms evolving upwards to form more complex living organisms. Like the other days of Creation Week, God simply speaks His Word and an uncountable number of living creatures fill the sea and the air. All creatures are created full grown with their own unique genetic coding completely formed. According to Genesis 1:20-21, this all happened on the fifth day when God says; “Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens”. So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters abounded, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good”. \pIt is very clear from Scripture that birds do not evolve from reptiles as is commonly touted by some evolutionary scientists. While there may be variation and change within a species after creation, such as different kinds of dogs, this has absolutely nothing to do with the instantaneous creation of all the different species of birds and water creatures in one 24-hour period. Science, with its vast amount of information, has absolutely no way of explaining or contributing to our understanding of how the incredible events of Creation Week happened. Evolutionary explanations defy every form of rational process and known true science. There are two main reasons that science has difficulty explaining Evolution. Evolution is biologically impossible and there is no scientific evidence for it because it never happened.",
4115,Creation Day 6,Day#6 Creation,Day#6 Creation,,"God begins the sixth day of Creation Week by creating all land-based creatures “according to its kind”, according to Genesis 1:24-25. The land animals are divided into “cattle and creeping things and beast of the earth”. Cattle would probably include all four-legged domestic animals. The beasts of the earth would refer to all other land-based animals including the dinosaurs. Creeping things would refer to all forms of animals that walk on the earth, including all forms of insects that fly or move in some manner on the ground. Creation Day 6 is finished with the creation of Adam and Eve. With reference to Adam and Eve, Scripture does not use the phrase “according to its kind”. Instead Genesis 1:26-28 states, ”Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth”. So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth”. It is very clear that God created Adam and Eve to be the only animal in creation that can reproduce offspring that will be “in the image of God.” Adam and Eve were the first and only man and woman created fully mature. Adam and Eve were created by God on Saturday, October 19 – Day Six of Creation Week in 4115 BC. The Gregorian-Hebrew Calendar (GH) date for the sixth day of Creation, is Saturday, October 27 – Heshvan 6 in 4101 BC (GH).",
4115,Creation Day 6-Creation of Adam,Day#6 Creation,Day#6 Creation,,"Adam was created on Creation Day 6 of Creation Week and lived 930 years and 183 days, using DFC dating. Adam is the father of Seth and male ancestor of all human beings. Like the other parts of the created order, Adam and Eve are blessed by God and instructed to: “Be fruitful and multiply” and “fill the earth”. Adam and Eve are also instructed to subdue the earth and have dominion over all of God’s Creation. The phrase, “according to its kind”, is applied to all the birds, fish, and land animals, but not to Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve are the only part of Creation made in “His own image; in the image of God He created them”.",
4115,Creation Day 6-Creation of Eve,Day#6 Creation,Day#6 Creation,,Eve is created on Creation Day 6 of Creation Week to be a “helper” for Adam. Eve is the mother of Seth and female ancestor of all human beings.,
4115,God Blessed the Seventh Day,Day#7 Creation,Day#7 Creation,,"Genesis 2:1-3 says, “Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made”. Creation Day 7 is certainly a day that has been set apart from the other six days of Creation Week. Creation Day 7 is the day that God “sanctified” and “rested” from His Creation. God rested because Creation was complete. Genesis 1:31 states, “God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good”. God had created everything and it was perfect. Since sin had not entered the Creation equation at this point in time, there was no death, dying, decay, or disease. There was no rain, tornadoes, earthquakes, bad weather or weeds. Man did not have to work hard just to survive. Any plant food that was needed was readily available in some form of seed, fruit or vegetable for all of God’s creatures, including Man. There was a great abundance and diversity of types of food. Killing another animal to eat was not necessary. God ceased from all His creative work because nothing else needed to be done. When Adam and Eve fell into disobedience, God then turned His attention to the preservation of a fallen world that was always plunging toward death and decay. Since He is a Holy God and “the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23)"", God then began the process of Redemption. Since the penalty for sin is both eternal and spiritual death, Scripture begins to record the history of Salvation in Genesis 3:15 where it states, “He shall bruise your head”. This is the first mention of the “He” who would bring Salvation. The significance of Creation Day 7 is given more commentary by Moses during the Exodus. Jesus gives more insight into the purpose of the Sabbath and the inappropriate idolization of Creation Day 7 among the spiritually blind Jewish leaders in His teachings in the New Testament.",
4115,The Temptation and Fall of Man,EST,EST,,"The events of the Fall, and other events before the birth of Seth, are all estimated EST dates. Some historians have placed this event immediately after the Creation of Adam and Eve. Others have placed this event as much as 100 years later. Considering the depth of the fallen nature of mankind, this author and others have estimated this date is about two weeks after Creation Week. In this part of Scripture, we are given a very clear picture of Satan’s strategy for leading humans down the path to disobedience to God and His Word. Genesis 3:1 records the first question in recorded history, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?” One of Satan’s most effective tools is to get us to question God’s Word. Notice how Satan twists the question to imply that God would not allow Eve to eat from “every tree of the garden” instead of just the one tree in the “midst” of the garden that was prohibited. God had been very specific in his instructions to Adam in Genesis 2:17 where it states: “Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die”. These instructions are obviously given by Adam to Eve as seen in her statement to Satan in Genesis 3:2-3. After planting the seed of doubt in Eve’s mind about what God had actually said, Satan then turns his attention to casting doubt on God’s motives in giving instructions about the deadly consequences of disobedience to His Word. \pThe resulting first and still most popular of Satan’s lies, “You will not surely die”, is found in Genesis 3:4. Every lie related to the theory of Evolution is some form of questioning, lying, or twisting of God’s Word in order to persuade people to foolishly think that there are no serious or eternal consequences for disobedience to His Word. It is easy to ignore the consequences of disobedience to God’s Word as soon as you start doubting what He said. Those who think that the “days” of Creation Week mean something different than ordinary 24-hour days have fallen into this deception that comes straight from Hell. Once you begin to think of death and dying and millions of years of evolutionary “change by chance”, why would you need a Savior from the effects of the Fall? If Genesis 1:1 is not real history, in what chapter and verse do you think God starts telling the truth? This is always a good question to ask if you are listening to one of the many false teachers telling you the “real” meaning of the Book of Genesis and describes the days of Creation Week as something different than ordinary 24-hour days. Satan’s plan has always been to deceive people into thinking God’s Word does not mean what it says, there will be no serious consequences to disobedience, and God does not have your best interests in making His laws. This research will clearly show that belief in any form of Evolution is contrary to the stated text in Scripture. Belief in any form of an evolutionary lie is inconsistent with a belief in the God of the Bible as a totally sovereign Creator.",
4115,Adam and Eve are Cast Out of the Garden,EST,EST,,"When God casts Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden, this is probably an act of mercy and protection in addition to being a consequence of disobedience to God’s clear command. Before creating Eve in Genesis 2:17, God clearly explained to Adam the consequences of eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil when He says, “you shall surely die”. Fortunately for the rest of mankind, the resulting death from disobedience was not immediate. Adam would live another 930 years, according to Genesis 5:4-5, and would father many sons and daughters. Now that Adam and Eve were in a fallen state of sin, it is conceivable that if they ate from the Tree of Life, they would live forever in this fallen state. Obviously that was not God’s plan. It was God’s plan to begin providing a way of Salvation so that redeemed mankind could live forever in heaven with Him. God removes them from the Garden where they begin the process of dying. Fortunately for mankind, it would take Adam over 900 years before he would experience the physical penalty of death. Adam and Eve will experience living in a fallen world while experiencing God’s Grace and promise of a future eternal life with Him without the presence of sin. Adam and Eve at this point are like God in the sense that they know the difference between Good and Evil. God knows Good and Evil due to His Holiness and Omniscience. Evil is not a part of God nor is it generated from Him. In contrast, Adam and Eve know Good and Evil by experience and will spend the rest of their lives learning that God’s Word means what He says and that there are consequences when we are disobedient to His commands. It could be argued that Adam and Eve were naïve to the consequences of sin since they had never witnessed any form of death prior to the Fall. This event of being removed from the Garden of Eden should give us all reason to make sure we understand what God’s Word says and what it means by what it says. Being ignorant or naïve about His Word does not remove us from the consequences of our sinful actions and desires.",
